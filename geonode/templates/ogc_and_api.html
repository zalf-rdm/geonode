<h3>{% trans "1. Overview" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans "All published geospatial layers in the ZALF Repository can be accessed through Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) services. Depending on the dataset type, different service interfaces are available, such as WMS for visualization, WFS for vector data access, and OGC API for modern web-based access." %}

<ul>
    <li>{% trans "Map visualization for web and desktop GIS (e.g. QGIS, WebGIS clients)." %}</li>
    <li>{% trans "Download and filter of vector features and coverage data." %}</li>

<h3>{% trans "2. Classic OGC Web Services" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans "The repository exposes datasets via standard OGC Web Services. Typical endpoints include WMS, WFS, WCS and related capabilities documents." %}
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>WMS (Web Map Service)</strong> – 
        {% trans "for map visualization, styled raster and vector layers, and background maps." %}
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>WFS (Web Feature Service)</strong> – 
        {% trans "for access to vector features (points, lines, polygons) in machine-readable formats such as GML or GeoJSON." %}
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>WCS (Web Coverage Service)</strong> – 
        {% trans "for raster and coverage data, including gridded environmental variables or model outputs." %}
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>WMTS / Tiled Services</strong> – 
        {% trans "for efficient, tiled map rendering in web applications." %}

<h3>{% trans "3. OGC API – Modern Web APIs" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans "Where supported by the platform, the ZALF Repository also offers OGC API endpoints (e.g. OGC API - Features) that provide RESTful, JSON-based access to geospatial data." %}

<ul>
    <li>{% trans "Simple HTTP/HTTPS requests with JSON responses." %}</li>
    <li>{% trans "Filtering, paging, and querying of features via URL parameters." %}</li>

<h3>{% trans "5. Using the Services in GIS Software" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans "You can connect to the ZALF Repository from standard GIS tools such as QGIS or ArcGIS by adding the corresponding OGC service URL." %}
</p>

<ul>
    <li>{% trans "In QGIS: use ‘Add WMS/WMTS Layer’ or ‘Add WFS Layer’ and paste the service URL." %}</li>
