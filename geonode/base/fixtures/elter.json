      "habitat_description": "Marine benthic habitats are the bed of seas directly connected to the oceans, i.e. part of the continuous body of water which covers the greater part of the earth’s surface and which surrounds its land masses. They may be under waters which are fully saline, brackish or almost fresh. Marine benthic habitats include those below spring high tide limit (or below mean water level in non-tidal waters) and enclosed coastal saline or brackish waters, without a permanent surface connection to the sea but either with intermittent surface or sub-surface connections (as in lagoons). Rockpools in the supralittoral zone are considered as enclaves of the marine zone. Marine benthic habitats also include marine littoral habitats which are subject to wet and dry periods on a tidal cycle including tidal saltmarshes; marine littoral habitats which are normally water-covered but intermittently exposed due to the action of wind or atmospheric pressure changes; freshly deposited marine strandlines characterised by marine invertebrates. Waterlogged littoral saltmarshes and associated saline or brackish pools above the mean water level in non-tidal waters or above the spring high tide limit in tidal waters are included with marine habitats. Marine benthic habitats further include constructed marine saline habitats below water level as defined above (such as in marinas, harbours, etc) which support a semi-natural community of both plants and animals. The splash zone immediately above the mean water line, as well the spray zone and any zone subject to sporadic inundation with salt water and inhabited predominantly by marine species, is included in marine habitats. The adjacent zone only very rarely subject to salt spray and dominated by terrestrial species is considered part of coastal habitats (N). Supralittoral sands and wracks may be found also in coastal habitats (N)."

      "habitat_description": "Lichen communities typically form a distinct zone or band in a 'splash' zone on most rocky shores. This splash zone occurs above the main intertidal zone (i.e. that subject to regular covering by the tide) and blends into angiosperm-dominated communities of coastal (terrestrial) habitats at its upper limits. The width of the splash zone varies considerably, depending on the degree of exposure of the shore to wave action. On very exposed coasts the zone is very wide, extending 10s of meters up cliffs, whilst in very sheltered sites it may be only a metre or so high. Several biotopes have been identified. Yellow and grey lichens such as Xanthoria parietina, Caloplaca marina, Caloplaca thallincola or Ramalina sp. dominate the supralittoral rock (MA1-211) with the distinctive black band of  Verrucaria maura occurring below in the littoral fringe (MA1-2131, MA1-2132). Small green seaweeds can sometimes be found in this splash zone, where localised conditions allow growth in what would otherwise be inhospitable conditions for seaweeds. Such an example is the green seaweed Prasiola stipitata which occurs in areas of nitrate enrichment from nearby roosting seabirds (MA1-212). The littoral fringe on soft rock can be characterised by the green seaweed Blidingia minima (MA1-214) while steep and vertical rock influenced by freshwater in the littoral fringe can be dominated by the green seaweeds Ulothrix flacca, Urospora penicilliformis and Urospora wormskioldii (MA1-215). The winkle Littorina saxatilis is one of the few 'marine' species found in this environment.\r\nSituation: This habitat type is found in the littoral fringe and the supralittoral zone on all rocky shores if there is sufficient seawater spray to maintain a viable community."

In wave exposed conditions, where the effects of sea-spray extend further up the shore, the lichens generally form a wide and distinct band. This band then becomes less distinct as wave exposure decreases, and in sheltered locations, cobbles and pebbles may also support the biotope. Pools, damp pits and crevices in the rock are occasionally occupied by winkles such as Littorina saxatilis and halacarid mites may also be present.\r\nSituation: This biotope is usually found at the top of the shore, immediately above a zone of the black lichen V. maura (MA1-2131, MA1-2132). Above the band of MA1-211, and occasionally in crevices in the rock alongside the lichens, terrestrial plants such as the thrift Armeria maritima and other angiosperms often occur.

Geographical variation: On northern and eastern shores the barnacle is usually S. balanoides, which is normally restricted to the lower littoral fringe, with a band of V. maura only in the upper littoral fringe. On south-west and western shores the barnacle is usually C. montagui which may extend over the whole of the littoral fringe zone.\r\nSituation: MA1-2131 is usually found on more exposed coasts below the V. maura biotope MA1-2132.

Several variants are identified. Some shores are characterised by dense bands of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides and the limpet Patella vulgata (MA1-223). The barnacles may be covered by Porphyra umbilicalis on the upper shore of exposed sites. Cracks and crevices in the rock provide a refuge for small individuals of the mussel M. edulis, winkles Littorina saxatilis and the whelk Nucella lapillus. Red seaweeds also frequently occupy damp crevices, particularly Ceramium shuttleworthianum, Corallina officinalis, Osmundea pinnatifida and encrusting coralline algae, but the non-vesiculate form of the wrack Fucus vesiculosus might be present (MA1-2232). Large numbers of the winkle Littorina littorea often dominate fields of large boulders or shores with a more mixed substratum (MA1-2233). There is much regional variation affecting the zonation of barnacles in the British Isles. In the north-west C. montagui and/or C. stellatus can form a distinct band above S. balanoides. In the south-west C. montagui and/or C. stellatus can be the dominant barnacles throughout the eulittoral zone (MA1-2221). On the east coasts S. balanoides is able to extend to the upper shore due to the absence of Chthamalus spp. and thereby any competition. The lichen Lichina pygmaea may be prominent, especially in the south, where it can form distinct patches or even a separate zone among the Chthamalus spp. (MA1-2222). In areas of soft rock (e.g. shales), the barnacles may be scarce or absent and the rock dominated by P. vulgata.\r\nSituation: This habitat type is found in the mid to upper eulittoral on very to moderately exposed shores below the lichen dominated biotopes (MA1-215) and is typically characterised by patches of mussels M. edulis interspersed with barnacles. Below MA1-22 is a community dominated by the wrack Himanthalia elongata and red seaweeds such as C. officinalis, Mastocarpus stellatus and O. pinnatifida (MA1-23).

In addition, patches of lichen Lichina pygmaea with the barnacle Chthamalus montagui (MA1-2221) may also occur above this biotope, particularly on southern shores.\r\nTemporal variation: Severe winter storms can cause periodic removal of this mussel and barnacle community."

      "habitat_name": "Seaweed communities on full salinity Atlantic littoral rock",
      "habitat_description": "This habitat type encompasses littoral rock habitats dominated by seaweeds. The seaweed community varies depending on the wave exposure and tidal currents. \r\n\r\nIn areas of high energy, the physical stresses caused by wave action often results in dwarf forms of the individual seaweeds. The strong holdfasts and short tufts structure of the wracks Fucus distichus and Fucus spiralis f. nana allow these fucoids to survive on extremely exposed shores in the north and north-west (MA1-231). Another seaweed able to tolerate the wave-wash is the red seaweed Corallina officinalis, which can form a dense turf on the mid to lower shore (MA1-232). The wrack Himanthalia elongata occurs on the lower shore and can extend on to moderately exposed shores (MA1-233). The red seaweed Mastocarpus stellatus is common on both exposed and moderately exposed shores, where it may form a dense turf (particularly on vertical or overhanging rock faces, MA1-235). Very exposed to moderately exposed lower eulittoral rock can support a pure stand of the red seaweedPalmaria palmata. It is found either as a dense band or in large patches above the main sublittoral fringe (MA1-234). Exposed to moderately exposed lower eulittoral rock characterised by extensive areas or a distinct band of Osmundea pinnatifida (MA1-236). Outcrops of fossilised peat in the eulittoral are soft enough to allow a variety of piddocks, such as Barnea candida and Petricola pholadiformis, to bore into them (MA1-237). This biotope is rare. Other species such as the anemone Halichondria panicea, the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, the limpet Patella vulgata, the mussel Mytilus edulis and the whelk Nucella lapillus can be present as well, but they are never dominant as in MA1-22. There is also a higher number of seaweeds present including the red Palmaria palmata,Lomentaria articulata, Ceramium spp. and the brown seaweeds Laminaria digitata and Fucus serratus. The green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva lactuca and Cladophora rupestris are occasionally present.\r\n\r\nIn tide-swept conditions on sheltered to extremely sheltered mid eulittoral to lower eulittoral rocky shores, such as narrow channels in sea lochs, the middle shore can be dominated by the wrack Ascophyllum nodosum (MA1-238), while Fucus serratus is dominating the lower shore (MA1-239, MA1-23A). The high levels of water movement encourages a rich associated fauna including several filter-feeding groups. These include the sponges Grantia compressa,Halichondria panicea and Hymeniacidon perleve which frequently occur on steep and overhanging faces of boulders and bedrock. It also includes the sea squirts Dendrodoa grossularia and Ascidiella scabra, which occur on steep surfaces and beneath boulders. Hydroids such as the pink Clava multicornis can form colonies on A. nodosum while Dynamena pumila is more often found on Fucus vesiculosus or F. serratus. Underneath the canopy formed by the brown seaweeds is a diverse community of the red seaweeds Gelidium pusillum, Chondrus crispus, Lomentaria articulata, Membranoptera alata and coralline crusts, but the green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva lactuca and Cladophora rupestris can be present. The filamentous red seaweed Polysiphonia lanosa can usually be found growing on A. nodosum. On the rock beneath are the limpet Patella vulgata and the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, while the crab Carcinus maenas and a variety of winkles including Littorina littorea, Littorina mariae and Littorina obtusata can be found on or among the boulders. The whelk Nucella lapillus can either be found in cracks and crevices.\r\nSituation: Sheltered tide-swept shores (i.e. estuaries and sea lochs) below the Fucus spiralis and F. vesiculosus band and above the kelp dominated zone in the sublittoral.\r\n\r\nDense blankets of fucoid seaweeds dominate in sheltered to extremely sheltered rocky shores and/or in locally sheltered patches on exposed to moderately exposed rocky shores. Typically, the wrack Pelvetia canaliculata (MA1-23B) occurs on the upper shore, with the wrack Fucus spiralis (MA1-23C) below. The middle shore is dominated by vast areas of the wrack Ascophyllum nodosum or the wrack Fucus vesiculosus (MA1-23D, MA1-23E) or a mixture of both. The wrack Fucus serratus covers lower shore bedrock and boulders (MA1-23F). Sheltered to very sheltered mixed substrata (pebbles and cobbles overlying muddy sand and gravel) shores can support fucoid communities (MA1-23C2; MA1-23D2; MA1-23E2; MA1-23F2).\r\n\r\nEphemeral seaweeds can occur on disturbed littoral rock in the lower to upper shore. Dominant green seaweeds include Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva lactuca and the red seaweeds Rhodothamniella floridula and Porphyra purpurea. Winkles such as Littorina littorea and Littorina saxatilis, the limpet Patella vulgata and the barnacles Semibalanus balanoides can occur, though usually in low abundance. The crab Carcinus maenas can be found where boulders are present, while the barnacle Elminius modestus is usually present on sites subject to variable salinity. On moderately exposed shores, the biotope is Enteromorpha spp. on freshwater-influenced or unstable upper shore rock (MA1-23G) or P. purpurea and/or Enteromorpha spp. on sand-scoured mid to lower eulittoral rock (MA1-23H). These are biotopes with a low species diversity and the relatively high number of species in the characterising species list are due to a variation in the species composition from site to site, not to high species richness on individual sites."

The predominant red seaweeds are usually Mastocarpus stellatus, Osmundea pinnatifida, Corallina officinalis and Palmaria palmata that tend to grow over a crust of the pink coralline algae Lithothamnion spp. Any patches between the algal turf may be colonised by barnacles Semibalanus balanoides, or Balanus perforatus in the south-west, and by the limpet Patella vulgata. Pits and crevices in the rock often provide a refuge for the whelk Nucella lapillus, the winkle Littorina spp. and small individuals of the mussel Mytilus edulis. Besides the dominant seaweeds there are a number of other red, brown and green seaweeds present. These include species such as the red seaweeds Dumontia contorta, Lomentaria articulata, Porphyra spp., the kelp Laminaria digitata and the green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva lactuca and Cladophora rupestris.\r\nSituation: On some shores this biotope may occur as a distinct zone between a Fucus serratus and red algal turf (MA1-2441) and the kelp Alaria esculenta and L. digitata community (MB1-2112). This biotope generally characterises those shores which are too exposed for F. serratus to form a dense canopy, often occurring as large patches within the F. serratus / red seaweed turf zone (MA1-2441). Consequently, F. serratus plants frequently occur amongst the H. elongata and red seaweed turf.\r\nTemporal variation: In early spring only characteristic H. elongata buttons are present, while the long erect parts of the thalli appears later in the season. This biotope may therefore appear very similar to MA1-2321 in the spring and care should be taken when assessing these biotopes in early spring (See Similar biotopes)."

Other seaweeds including the red Lomentaria articulata and Osmundea pinnatifida, Palmaria palmata, Corallina officinalis and coralline crusts. The wrack Fucus serratus and the green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ulva lactuca may also be present though usually at a low abundance. Although both M. stellatus and C. crispus are widespread in the lower eulittoral and the sublittoral fringe, they occur only infrequently in a distinct band, or in large enough patches, to justify separation from MA1-2441. Consequently, where only small patches of these species occur within a larger area of mixed red algal turf, then records should be assigned to more general mixed red algal turf biotope (MA1-232; MA1-233). M. stellatus can be present in high abundance in a number of biotopes (MA1-232: MA1-233; MA1-2441 etc.) found on the shore. At least one other species normally co-dominates and records should be assigned to the appropriate biotope. Caution should be taken regarding the characterising species list due to the low number of records. More information needed to validate this description.\r\nSituation: This biotope can form a band above the main kelp zone, above Alaria esculenta (MB1-211) or the mussel Mytilus edulis (MA1-221) or within a F. serratus -red algal mosaic (MA1-2441).\r\nTemporal variation: M. stellatus is more resistant to wave action than C. crispus and may therefore dominate more exposed shores; it can dominate vertical rock at very exposed sites (e.g. Mingulay, Outer Hebrides). On more sheltered shores, especially in the south-west, M. stellatus may give way to C. crispus which has a faster growth rate."

      "habitat_description": "The lower eulittoral zone on soft rock shores (e.g. chalk) characterised by the wrack Fucus serratus. Much of the community associated with this biotope is the same as the biotope MA1-23F1, but certain taxa are specific to the soft underlying substrata. Rock-boring fauna including the piddocksBarneaspp., Pholas dactylus and Hiatella arctica can occur in dense aggregations. Burrowing polychaetes such as Polydora spp. can also occur in high numbers only visible due to their long, slender palps waving in the water as they occupy holes in the top few centimetres of the rock. A dense red algal turf occurs beneath the F. serratus and includes Gelidium pusillum, Osmundea pinnatifida, Palmaria palmata, Lomentaria articulata and Rhodothamniella floridula, but also calcareous algae such as Corallina officinalis and coralline crusts including the red-violet encrusting algae Phymatolithon lenormandii are present. Infaunal taxa such as various amphipods may be common amongst the seaweeds. The empty piddock holes may provide a refuge for species such as the anemone Actinia equina and the mussel Mytilus edulis  while the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, the limpetPatella vulgatacan be present on the surface of the soft rock. The whelk Nucella lapillus, the winkles Littorina littorea and Littorina mariae and the top shell Gibbula cineraria are all present on the soft rock among the seaweeds. The high number of characterising species is partly caused by the low number of records used to define this biotope. The high % frequency of occurrence is partly a result of the low number of records. More data is needed to validate this biotope description.\r\nSituation: This biotope usually occurs immediately below either a Fucus vesiculosus -barnacle mosaic (unit MA1-243) or a Mytilus edulis  and piddocks-dominated biotope (MA1-248) on moderately exposed shores or a dense canopy of F. vesiculosus (MA1-23D) or Ascophyllum nodosum (MA1-23E1) on sheltered shores. The littoral fringe below are on moderately exposed shores dominated by the kelp Laminaria digitata (MB1-2173), while the kelp Laminaria saccharina may co-dominate on sheltered shores (MB1-23A1; MB1-23A2)."

      "habitat_description": "Rockpools occur where the topography of the shore allows seawater to be retained within depressions in the bedrock producing 'pools' on the retreat of the tide. As these rockpool communities are permanently submerged they are not directly affected by height on the shore and normal rocky shore zonation patterns do not apply. For this reason rockpools have been dealt with as a separate habitat type, apart from the scheme of wave exposure and shore height. Four main rockpool biotopes have been described, and although it is accepted that an enormous variety of rockpool communities exist, it is hoped that these biotope descriptions are broad enough to adequately encompass most types. It would be meaningless to include the characterising species in a description at the habitat type level. Rockpools on the upper shore which are subject to rainwater influence and wide fluctuations in temperature are included in MA1-52. Shallow rockpools in the mid to upper shore characterised by encrusting coralline algae and Corallina officinalis (MA1-262); several variants of these coralline pools occur in south-west Britain and Ireland (MA1-2622, MA1-2623 and MA1-2624). Deeper rockpools on the mid to lower shore can support fucoids and some sublittoral species such as kelp (MA1-263). Those rockpools influenced by the presence of sand are characterised by sand-tolerant seaweed such as Furcellaria lumbricalis and Polyides rotundus (MA1-264). Where more stable sand occurs in the base of the rockpool sea-grass beds can occur. Shallow rockpools on mixed cobbles, pebbles, gravel and sand may be characterised by hydroids (MA1-265). A very rough guideline to the terms \"shallow\" and \"deep\" rockpools: \"shallow\" rockpools do not support kelp, whereas \"deep\" rockpools do. MA1-26 does not include shallow standing water on compacted sediment or mixed substrata.\r\nSituation: Rockpools occur in the littoral zone where the topography of the shore allows seawater to be retained within depressions in the bedrock producing 'pools' on the retreat of the tide."

In south and west Ireland these coralline pools may be dominated by the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the seaweed diversity is generally low due to the grazing pressure of P. lividus, the top shells Gibbula cineraria and Gibbula umbilicalis, and winkles such as Littorina littorea. Within the pools, pits and crevices are often occupied by the anemone such as Actinia equina and Anemonia viridis and small individuals of the mussel Mytilus edulis. The siphonous green seaweed Codium spp. can also be present along with the wrack Himanthalia elongata and the brown seaweed Leathesia difformis and the filamentous red seaweed Ceramium spp. The barnacle Semibalanus balanoides is either absent or occurs at low abundance in these rockpools, presumably due to the grazing pressure on the larval stage and the predation pressure from the whelk Nucella lapillus. Soft bedrock, such as limestone, allows P. lividus to bore into the rock.\r\nSituation: Rockpools throughout the eulittoral and lower littoral fringe in bedrock on very exposed to exposed shores.\r\nTemporal variation: The ephemeral green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ulva lactuca can occur during the summer."

      "habitat_description": "Where caves and overhangs occur on rocky shores, the shaded nature of the habitat diminishes the amount of desiccation suffered by biota during periods of low tides which allows certain species to proliferate. In addition, the amount of scour, wave surge, sea spray and penetrating light determines the unique community assemblages found in upper, mid and lower shore caves and overhangs on the lower shore. Biotopes from the surrounding shore such as MA1-221, MA1-223 or any of the fucoid communities occasionally extend into cave entrances. MA1-223 often extends some way into the cave. Other open shore biotopes may also be found within caves, such as the green seaweed Prasiola stipitata on cave roofs where birds roost (MA1-212), and localised patches of green algae where freshwater seepage influences the rock (MA1-23G). Rockpools containing encrusting coralline algae (MA1-262), fucoids and kelp (MA1-263) and hydroids and littorinid molluscs may occur also on the floor of cave entrances. The cave biotope descriptions are largely based on data obtained from surveys of Berwickshire caves (ERT,2000), chalk caves from the Thanet coast (Tittley et al., 1998; Tittley & Spurrier 2001) and data from Wales (CCW Phase 1 data). In general, the biomass and diversity of algal species found in upper and mid-shore littoral caves decreases with increasing depth into the cave as the light levels diminish. Fucoids are usually only found at the entrances to caves, but red algae, and filamentous and encrusting green algae are able to penetrate to lower light intensities towards the back of the cave, and mats of the turf forming red seaweed Audouinella purpurea and/or patches of the green seaweed Cladophora rupestris may occur on the upper walls (MA1-274). Brownish velvety growths of the brown algae Pilinia maritima occurring in mats with the red alga A. purpurea on cave walls and upper littoral levels of cliffs (MA1-273) should not be confused with the green (MA1-272) or golden brown algal stains often found above this zone on the ceilings of the caves (MA1-273; MA1-271). Below is a zone of Verrucaria mucosa and/or Hildenbrandia rubra on the inner and outer reaches (MA1-275). Fauna usually only occur on the lower and mid walls of the caves and generally comprise barnacles, anemones and tube-forming polychaetes (MA1-278; MA1-279) depending on the level of boulder scour or wave surge. Where the floors of caves consist of mobile cobbles and small boulders, little algae and fauna occur due to the effects of scouring (MA1-27A). Vertical or steeply sloping cave walls and overhangs on the mid and lower shore, subject to wave-surge but without scour, support a rich biota of sponges, hydroids, ascidians and shade-tolerant red algae (MA1-277, MA1-276 or MA1-2761).\r\nSituation: Caves and overhangs in the littoral zone in hard rock and limestone (including chalk)."

The lower section of the wall which is subject to greatest scour may be characterised by a band of Pomatoceros triqueter and spirorbid tube-forming polychaetes. In wave sheltered conditions, this biotope may extend to the cave ceiling. The rear of caves on the lower shore may support only sparse fauna consisting of spirorbid polychaetes and barnacles such as Chthamalus montagui with scattered Pomatoceros sp., scattered bryozoan and coralline crusts and in the south-west, occasional Sabellaria alveolata. Shade-tolerant red algae such as Lomentaria articulata may occasionally occur. Due to the low species abundance in this biotope, there may be a variation from cave to cave, depending on local conditions.\r\nSituation: This biotope is found in caves between the barren (of macro-fauna or flora) or very species poor zone (unit MA1-27A) and the wave-surged, more densely populated zone (MA1-278). On the walls above the scour and near the cave entrance the community may grade into a red algal dominated community (unit MA1-274)."

However, where light is available around the cave entrances, encrusting coralline algae may cover the rock and boulder surfaces. In some instances they may support sparse fauna such as the limpet Patella spp. and the winkle Littorina saxatilis.\r\nSituation: This biotope is situated on the floor, or at the base of cave walls, often with a zone of unit MA1-279 above (where the scouring effect of boulders is less). In areas of extreme wave exposure this zone will extend high up the sides of the cave and in less wave-exposed conditions where the effects of scouring are reduced, some fauna may be present. At the entrances and 2-3 metres into upper shore caves, a zone of unit MA1-223 may occur above the MA1-27A, becoming a zone of MA1-275 further into the cave. In mid shore caves, this unit is above by a zone of unit MA1-279 (sparse fauna), and in caves on the lower shore, the surge-tolerant unit MA1-2761 may occur above this zone.\r\nTemporal variation: In calmer summer months cave mouths may have some ephemeral algae (e.g. Enteromorpha intestinalis) and a spat-fall of barnacles or limpets."

      "habitat_description": "Where caves and overhangs occur on rocky shores, the shaded nature of the habitat diminishes the amount of desiccation suffered by biota during  periods of low water which allows certain species to proliferate. In addition, the amount of scour, wave surge, sea spray and penetrating light determines the unique community assemblages found in upper, mid- and lower shore caves and overhangs on the lower shore. All around the Black Sea this habitat type occurs in the Sarmatian limestone cliffs in Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. It may also occur in volcanic and metamorphic rocks, such as Maslen Nos Cape in Bulgaria. The height of the entrance varies from 50 cm up to 25 m depending on the strength of the waves. The length of the water gallery is between 3 and 50 m and is sometimes followed by dry or semi-dry galleries with sand, gravel and larger stones. Natural light does not reach the inner reaches of the longest caves. Characteristic species: During the warm season some of the larger caves are inhabited by colonies of bat species (Miniopterus schreibersii, Myotis blythii, Myotis myotis and Myotis capaccinii). Birds may often also nest at the entrance of the caves. Caves with sandy underground banks were once regularly inhabited by the Monk Seal (Monachus monachus), which is now extinct in the Black Sea. The marine part of the caves is covered by invertebrate- dominated communities. Sciaphilic algae is only present at or near the entrance, where there is still some, albeit diminished, light. Most frequent at the entrance are the red alga Phyllophora crispaand the brown alga Zanardinia typus, while inside the cave only encrusting algae (Hildenbrandia, Lithophyllum, Phymatolithon) occur. The completely dark interior is dominated by either hydrozoan and bryozoan turfs or extensive sponge crusts (erect sponges Halichondia, Haliclona, Dysidea spp. or thin crust sponges), depending on current intensity."

Its size depends on the morphology of the substratum and – especially – on the intensity of the humectation, and may vary from several centimeters to one meter.\r\nThis habitat, particularly characterised by the presence of crust-forming melobesiae algae, varies according to the nature of the substratum and the humectation, thus causing the forming of local facies.\r\nThis formation is frequent in the western Mediterranean in areas with pure water and rough waters. It constitutes a major and particularly attractive element in the rocky coast landscape. It is found in the area where the waves break; its upper surface may emerge at 20-30 centimeters above the middle level of the sea. It develops on every type of substratum and can be up to 1 to 2 meters wide. The rim is formed by successive, more or less indurate and re-crystallised, layers of alga, with which the calcareous tests of some animals are mixed. The lower side presents many cavities that have been enlarged by rock-destroying organisms and in which a rich sciaphilous fauna finds refuge."

When the water is calm, the rim emerges completely, and its outer edge extends to 20 to 30 centimeters above the water, a position that is possible because it is present where there is strong wave action and because of the porosity of the formation. The height above the middle level is linked to the local degree of roughness. In crevices and little coves that are open to the swell and sheltered from the direct rays of the sun, it may be of considerable width and thickness. Rims that are over two meters wide have been seen. The rim is formed by the stacking up of calcareous Lithophyllum byssoides thalli with a re-crystallising of the deeper layers. Three successive layers may be seen, whose respective thickness depends on environmental and local history conditions. Only the upper part is alive. At the base of the living part of the Lithophyllum byssoides many endolithic Cyanophyceae (Brachytrichia, Calothrix and Entophysalis genuses) can be observed. The lower surface of the ledge, often below the average level, is dead and covered with sciaphilous animal and plant assemblages. Destructive animals (Cliona, Lithophaga) bore into the rock, creating cavities which contain an upper infralittoral type of fauna and flora. In less favourable environmental conditions, the Lithophyllum constructions are mere pads in the mediolittoral area."

In the exposed cavity formations, a terrestrial fauna is found based on acari, pseudo-scorpions and Chilopoda. The supralittoral and – especially – mediolittoral parts are covered with crust-forming algae.\r\nThe crevices or the entrances of the caves present variation gradients of the ambient factors that are essential for the distribution of species: reduction in hydrodynamics, and in light. The bottom of these cavities presents an area of very high humidity that encourages organisms that usually live more deeply to live there, and this results in the zonation getting mixed up.\r\nGiven the reduced hydrodynamics, there is in this habitat an accumulation of floating detritus and objects.\r\nThe variability is linked to both the size of crevice or cave, and the position of the openings in relation to the dominant hydrodynamics.

The sand based tubes formed by S. alveolata form large reef-like hummocks, which serve to stabilise the boulders and cobbles. Other species in this biotope include the barnacles Semibalanus balanoides and Elminius modestus and the limpet Patella vulgata, the winkle Littorina littorea, the mussel Mytilus edulis and the whelk Nucella lapillus. The anemone Actinia equina and the crab Carcinus maenas can be present in cracks and crevices on the reef. Low abundance of seaweeds tend to occur in areas of eroded reef. The seaweed diversity can be high and may include the foliose red seaweeds Palmaria palmata, Mastocarpus stellatus, Osmundea pinnatifida, Chondrus crispus and some filamentous species e.g. Polysiphonia spp. and Ceramium spp. Coralline crusts can occur in patches. Wracks such as Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus serratus and the brown seaweed Cladostephus spongiosus may occur along with the ephemeral green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ulva lactuca. On exposed surf beaches in the south-west S. alveolata forms a crust on the rocks, rather than the classic honeycomb reef form, and may be accompanied by the barnacle Balanus perforatus (typically common to abundant). On wave-exposed shores in Ireland, the wrack Himanthalia elongata can also occur.\r\nSituation: Above this unit are biotopes dominated either by ephemeral seaweeds, such as Enteromorpha spp. and Porphyra spp. or the perennial wrack Fucus vesiculosus on mixed substrata (units MA1-243; MA1-23D2; MA4-211; MA1-23H).

This biotope is also found in lower shore tide-swept areas, such as in the tidal narrows of Scottish sealochs. A fauna of dense juvenile mussels may be found in sheltered firths, attached to algae on shores of pebbles, gravel, sand, mud and shell debris with a strandline of fucoid algae.\r\nSituation: High densities of juvenile mussels attached to seaweed have been recorded from sheltered shores of the Dornoch Firth and Moray Firth. Adult mussel beds can be found below a band of ephemeral green seaweeds (MA4-211) on more exposed, predominantly rocky shores. On sheltered, predominantly rocky shores either a Fucus vesiculosus dominated biotope or a biotope dominated by the wrack Ascophyllum nodosum (MA1-23D2; MA1-23E2) can be found above, or the barnacle dominated biotope (MA1-2233).\r\nTemporal variation: The temporal stability of mussel beds can vary a lot.

The wrack Fucus vesiculosus is often found attached to either the mussels or cobbles and it can be abundant. The mussels are often encrusted with the barnacles Semibalanus balanoides, Elminius modestus or Balanus crenatus. Where boulders are present they can support the limpet Patella vulgata.

The characterising species list shown below is based on data from epifaunal sampling only. Three sub-biotopes are recognised for this biotope, distinguished principally on the basis of the sediment type associated with the mussel beds. The three types of intertidal mussel beds may be part of a continuum on an axis that is most strongly influenced by the amount of pseudofaeces that accumulate amongst the mussels. The differences may not always be directly connected to the underlying substratum on which the mussel bed may have started a long time ago. It should be noted that there are few data available for the muddy (MA2-2713) and sandy (MA2-2712) subunits, therefore there are no characterising species lists or comparative tables for these two sub-biotopes.\r\nSituation: On more exposed, predominantly rocky shores this biotope can be found below a band of ephemeral green seaweeds (unit MA4-211). On sheltered, predominantly rocky shores either a F. vesiculosus dominated biotope or a biotope dominated by the wrack Ascophyllum nodosum (MA1-23D2; MA1-23E2) can be found above or the barnacle dominated biotope (MA1-2233).

The wrack Fucus vesiculosus is often found attached to either the mussels or the cobbles and it can occur at high abundance.

Where boulders are present they can support the limpet Patella vulgata, the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus and the anemone Actinia equina. Ostrea edulis may occur on the lowest part of the shore.

Mussels Mytilus edulis grow attached to shell debris and live cockles Cerastoderma edule, forming patches of mussels on consolidated shell material, and often growing into extensive beds. The mussel valves are usually encrusted with barnacles such as Elminius modestus and Semibalanus balanoides, and the mussel bed provides a habitat for a range of species including Littorina littorea.

Further species may be present are the sand mason Lanice conchilega, the sand gaper Mya arenaria, the peppery furrow shell Scrobicularia plana, Nephtys spp., and the ragworm Hediste diversicolor. Scattered fronds of eelgrass Zostera noltii may occur.\r\nSituation: This biotope often occurs in large sandy estuaries, or on enclosed shores, alongside other sand and muddy sand biotopes, most notably unit MA5-252. It is possible that Lanice beds (unit MA5-255) occur lower down on the shore.\r\nTemporal variation: Where this sub-biotope occurs in very sheltered conditions on muddy sand, it could change to MA2-2713 over time as pseudofaeces build up forming a layer of mud. This cannot happen where wave action or tidal streams wash away pseudofaeces and prevent a build up. In areas where mussel spat (\"mussel crumble\") settles on the surface shell layer of cockle beds, the mussel cover may be ephemeral, as is the case in the Burry Inlet (south Wales, UK)."

      "habitat_description": "Vermetid platforms, or reefs, are built by the gastropod mollusc Dendropoma (Novastoa) petraeum, in association with some encrusting red seaweeds like Neogoniolithon brassica-florida. These reefs are often colonised by Vermetus triquetrus, another species of vermetid which, in both solitary and gregarious forms, occupies the portions of the structure that are permanently underwater. The bioconstructing vermetid is a highly gregarious species living in the tidal zone, to which it is particularly well adapted, thanks to the horny operculum that seals its shell opening in an airtight manner, thus enabling the animal to tolerate periodic emersions between tides. Vermetid reefs colonise the tidal zone exclusively on rocky coasts, with smaller formations according to the type of rock: calcarenite, limestone, dolomite, basalt and flysch. The presence of an abrasion platform thus becomes the essential condition for the formation of a reef. A second factor limiting the distribution and size of structures on a small scale is the extent of superficial hydrodynamics, as developed reefs are unlikely to be found in sheltered environments with calm waters"

Powerful hydrodynamics encourage the laying down of a coarse sediment. The fauna is basically made up of scavengers of detritus and their predators, and so essentially unstable. It is characterised by two crustaceans, the amphipod Echinogammarus olivii and the isopod Sphaeroma serratum."

The biotope occurs most frequently on medium and fine sandy shores, but may also occur on a wide variety of sediment shores composed of muddy sediment, shingle and mixed substrata, or on rocky shores. The decaying seaweed provides cover and humidity for the sandhopper  Talitrus saltator . In places on sand that regularly accumulate larger amounts of weed,  Talorchestia deshayesii  is often present. Oligochaetes, mainly enchytraeids, can occur where the stranded debris remains damp as a result of freshwater seepage across the shore or mass accumulation of weed in shaded situations. On shingle and gravel shores and behind saltmarshes the strandline talitrid species tend to be mainly  Orchestia  species. Abundances of the characterising species tend to be highly patchy. Two characterising species lists are presented below. They are derived from two sets of data, which were analysed separately. The first shows data from infaunal samples, the second shows data from epifaunal samples. The epifaunal lists contains no counts per square metre, as the data were collected on the SACFOR scale.\r\nSituation: This unit may occur on the same shore as a range of sediment (especially sandy) biotopes, where driftlines of algae and other debris accumulate on the upper shore. These biotopes include units MA3-211, MA5-231, MA5-232 MA5-233 and MA5-241. The biotope also occurs at the back of boulder, cobble and pebble shores, above mixed sediment and rocky biotopes.\r\nTemporal variation: This biotope varies in its position between spring and neap tides, and as a result of changing weather. After storms, it may extend into the fore dunes, during spring tides it will occur high on the shore, and during neaps the greatest numbers of talitrids may be found at or just below MHWN level. The amount of debris washed up on strandlines, and hence the extent of this biotope, may also vary significantly depending on factors such as recent storms or high tides."

Exactly what determines the distribution of  Z. noltii  is not entirely clear. It is often found in small lagoons and pools, remaining permanently submerged, and on sediment shores where the muddiness of the sediment retains water and stops the roots from drying out. An anoxic layer is usually present below 5 cm sediment depth. The infaunal community is characterised by the polychaetes Scoloplos armiger, Pygospio elegans and Arenicola marina, oligochaetes, the spire shell Hydrobia ulvae, and the bivalves Cerastoderma edule and Limecola  balthica (Macoma balthica). The green algae Enteromorpha spp. may be present on the sediment surface. The characterising species lists below give an indication both of the epibiota and of the sediment infauna that may be present in intertidal seagrass beds. The biotope is described in more detail in the British National Vegetation Classification (see the chapter on saltmarsh communities in Rodwell, 2000).\r\nSituation: Z. noltii  is most frequently found on lower estuary and sheltered coastal muddy sands, together with biotopes such as unit MA5-252.\r\nTemporal variation: There may be seasonal variation in the area covered by intertidal seagrass beds, as plants die back during cold temperatures in winter. Intertidal seagrass beds may also be subject to heavy grazing by geese, which can reduce the extent of the plant cover significantly.

The sediment contains little or no organic matter, and usually no anoxic layer is present at all. It tends to be well-drained, retaining little water at low tide, though the sediment of the MA5-2333 sub-unit may remain damp throughout the tidal cycle. These beaches usually occur under fully marine conditions, though the MA5-2332 sub-unit may occur under moderately exposed lower estuarine conditions. The mobility of the sediment leads to a species-poor community, dominated by polychaetes, isopods and burrowing amphipods. Scolelepis spp. can tolerate well-drained conditions, and are often present in well-draining, coarser sand. Burrowing amphipods that often occur in this biotope include Bathyporeia spp., Pontocrates arenarius, and Haustorius arenarius. The isopod Eurydice pulchra is also often present. On semi-exposed beaches with a moderate tide range where there is a marked high-shore berm, there can be a marked seepage at the foot of the berm that probably carries the products of the organic matter derived from strand line breakdown. Here in a narrow zone, exceptionally high populations of Bathyporeia pilosa, sometimes above 10000 per square metre, may occur. The zone may be narrower than the strandline and could easily be missed on surveys were only a few levels are sampled. Three sub-biotopes are described for this biotope, based principally on differences in infaunal species composition.\r\nSituation: Situated mainly on the mid and lower shore, sometimes upper shore, of exposed to moderately exposed beaches.

The sediment is not always well sorted, and may contain a subsurface layer of gravel or shell debris. Usually no anoxic layer is present. The mobility of the sediment leads to a species-poor community, dominated by the polychaetes Scolelepis squamata and S. foliosa. The amphipod Bathyporeia pilosa may be present. Further species that may be present in this sub-biotope include the amphipods  B. pelagica and Haustorius arenarius, and the isopod Eurydice pulchra.

The biotope generally occurs on exposed open coasts, but sometimes in estuarine conditions, supporting populations of the isopod Eurydice pulchra and burrowing amphipods which frequently include Bathyporeia pilosa and Haustorius arenarius. The degree of drainage appears to be a critical factor in determining the presence of polychaetes, with only Scolelepis squamata capable of tolerating the well-drained sediments of this biotope. This biotope has two facies: drying upper and mid shore sands, and highly mobile lower shore and shallow sublittoral sand bars. Where this biotope occurs in estuarine conditions, H. arenarius is often highly abundant.\r\nSituation:This unit may occur on the mid and upper shore together with unit MA5-2331, below MA6-2273, or above MA5-2333 and the MA5-241 communities. Under more exposed, open conditions, this unit may be restricted to the lower part of the shore, with MA6-2273, barren sand (MA5-231) or barren shingle (MA3-211) on the upper shore.

Typically, no anoxic layer is present. Fine sand shores support a range of species including amphipods and polychaetes. On the lower shore, and where sediments are stable, bivalves such as Angulus tenuis may be present in large numbers. An exceptionally rich fine sand community has been recorded from very sheltered reduced salinity shores in Poole Harbour. Species recorded include Anaitides maculata, Hediste diversicolor, Scoloplos armiger, Pygospio elegans, Tharyx killariensis, oligochaetes, Gammarus locusta, Hydrobia ulvae, Cerastoderma edule and Mya truncata.\r\nSituation: Fine sand communities may be present throughout the intertidal zone on moderately exposed beaches, or they may be present on the lower parts of the shore with mobile sand communities present along the upper shore. A strandline of talitrid amphipods (MA5-211) typically develops at the top of the shore where decaying seaweed accumulates.\r\nTemporal variation: Fine sand shores may show seasonal changes, with sediment accretion during calm summer periods and beach erosion during more stormy winter months. There may be a change in sediment particle size structure, with finer sediment grains washed out during winter months, leaving behind coarser sediments."

      "habitat_description": "Moderately exposed or sheltered beaches of medium and fine, usually clean, sand, though the sediment may on rare occasions contain a small silt and clay fraction. The sediment is relatively stable, remains damp throughout the tidal cycle, and contains little organic matter. It is often rippled and typically lacks an anoxic sub-surface layer. Where an anoxic layer is present, it occurs at a depth below 10 cm and tends to be patchy. The biotope occurs mainly on the lower part of the shore, and relatively frequently on the mid shore. It is only rarely present above mid shore level, except where coastal defences cause backwash onto the upper shore. Conditions are usually fully marine, though the biotope can also occur in open lower estuarine conditions. The infaunal community is dominated by a range of polychaete species such as Nephtys cirrosa, Paraonis fulgens, Spio spp., Pygospio elegans, Ophelia rathkei and Scoloplos armiger. The presence of polychaetes may be seen as coloured burrows running down from the surface of the sediment, and Arenicola marina casts may be present on the sediment surface. The amphipods Bathyporeia spp. and Pontocrates arenarius frequently occur, and nemerteans are often present. On some North Wales shores, the presence of Arenicola species characterises the lowest part of the shore, with a range of species characteristic of the shallow sublittoral. These include sparsely distributed Echinocardium, Amphiura brachiata, Ensis siliqua and Fabulina fabula. This biotope is split into three sub-biotopes, between which there can be a large degree of overlap. The bivalve Angulus tenuis dominates the MA5-2412 sub-biotope, which is characterised by slightly more stable and fine sediments than the other two sub-biotopes.\r\nSituation: This unit may be present below the communities of units MA5-233 or MA5-2321 on moderately exposed shores. MA5-231 may occur on the upper part of the shore if it is subject to drying in between tides. The strandline biotope MA5-211 may be present on the same shore where driftlines of decomposing seaweed and other debris occur on the upper shore.\r\nTemporal variation: The infauna of this biotope may be affected significantly by seasonal changes in degree of wave exposure. During stormy winters, the sediment may become de-stabilised, leading to the disappearance of some macroinfaunal species. The lugworm A. marina may be present occasionally, usually as a temporary recruitment and is likely to be washed out during storms."

This biotope carries commercially viable stocks of C. edule, and it is therefore possible to find areas of this habitat where the infauna may have been changed through recent cockle dredging. Cockle dredging can result in a reduced bivalve abundance and reduced densities of some polychaete species, including P. elegans (Moore, 1991). At the outer edges of large flats, there may be a zone between the cockle beds and more exposed sands, where there are fewer cockles and B. sarsi is the commoner species.\r\nSituation: The community is found mainly on the mid and lower shore where the sediment is water-saturated most of the time. Where it occurs in muddy sand, this unit has broad transition areas with units MA5-251 and the MA6-22, and where it occurs on clean sand shores, it may have broad transition areas with MA2-2712. Higher on the shore, adjacent to this biotope, MA5-254 is found, with fewer polychaete and bivalve species due to the drier sediment found on the upper shore.\r\nTemporal variation: A layer of mud with dense spionid polychaetes may build up on cockle beds in sheltered areas, creating a cohesive muddy layer 10-15 cm thick overlying the whole area. This may break up leaving a series of pits and patches with miniature cliffs, giving it an appearance similar to a stony shore when seen from a distance. It should be noted that where it occurs, Hydrobia ulvae tends to move a lot and may be highly variable in abundance."

      "habitat_description": "Area corresponding to the upper beach which is only humected by the sea during storms; however, certain areas do escape being totally submerged and receive a large amount of spray coming from the surge of the waves further down. 2 sets of phenomena are responsible for the dampness: at surface level, the dampness is caused by the salty spray from the breaking of the waves on the coast which is the main cause of the saltiness of the sand and the dampness of the night air. This humification only affects the top 2 or 3 centimetres and disappears quickly under the action of the sun; at depth, the sand is damp because of the proximity of the fairly unsalty ground water. The temperature is very variable and the daily differences in temperature may be extremely great: 0 to 20° in the winter, 50° in the summer. These temperatures can be lethal for individuals living in the sand.\r\nThe exogenous contribution of organic matter (wracks) is linked to the nature of what is washed up by the sea during storms or comes from the land. It is variable in time and space: tree trunks, bits of wood, detritic material which make up the wracks, algae, phanerogams, anthropic vegetable debris, dead marine organisms, aeolian-origin elements (leaves, insects), and foam from waves made up of “shaped or unshaped elements” of wind-borne marine plankton. To this can be added a fairly considerable quantity of biodegradable or non-biodegradable human-origin rubbish linked to the sea or to the direct waste from tourists frequenting the upper beach.\r\nThe physiognomy of the upper beach ranges from shifting sand on compact sand to the presence of fairly damp saline patches on coarse sand. The sea wracks contain floating objects basically washed up during storms and are of two major kinds: chips of wood and fairly well-shaped elements stuck in the sand and tree trunks and sizeable rubbish.\r\nThe sedimentary granulometry is relatively variable according to what fine elements have been added. The sediment is thus fairly compact. One can also notice a variability according to the quantity and quality of organic additions (sea foreshores), according to the direction and level of protection of the upper beach considered, and the degree of humectation, different facies can be observed (See facies and associations)."

Sediment is formed of fine sand, muddy sands and mud according to the course of the river bed. Surface salinity is low (0.03 to 2,5 for the Rhône) whereas that of the deep layer, in contact with the benthic fauna, is much higher (16 to 21 for the Rhône). A marine salty patch can be seen sunk underneath the fresh water of the river. Tides are weak and only cause minor changes in the water’s chlorinity. The winds have a more marked influence on the position of the salty patch. When parts of the estuary or the estuary lagoons are cut off, either naturally or by human action, the salinity of the water may increase considerably.\r\nPopulation variations are linked to the topography of the bed, which causes a differential distribution of the various types of sediment, and to anthropic action. These are especially reflected in the size of species populations, which varies with granulometry but can also be greatly reduced when anthropic action is too great. In the absence of the tide effect, the transition is rapid between the (freshwater) limnic environment and the marine environment. Thus there is no gradient in the distribution of the fauna, which occurs patchily. The species present are characterised by very rapid cycles of development that permit accelerated reconquest of the environments."

It should be noted that the presence of Z. noltii as scattered fronds does not change what is otherwise a muddy sand biotope. Exactly what determines the distribution of Z. noltii is not entirely clear. It is often found in small lagoons and pools, remaining permanently submerged, and on sediment shores where the muddiness of the sediment retains water and stops the roots from drying out. An anoxic layer is usually present below 5 cm sediment depth. The infaunal community is characterised by the polychaetes Scoloplos armiger, Pygospio elegans and Arenicola marina, oligochaetes, the spire shell Hydrobia ulvae, and the bivalves Cerastoderma edule and Limecola balthica (Macoma balthica). The green algae Enteromorpha spp. may be present on the sediment surface. The characterising species lists below give an indication both of the epibiota and of the sediment infauna that may be present in intertidal seagrass beds. The biotope is described in more detail in the British National Vegetation Classification (see the chapter on saltmarsh communities in Rodwell, 2000).\r\nSituation: Z. noltii is most frequently found on lower estuary and sheltered coastal muddy sands, together with biotopes such as unit MA5-252.\r\nTemporal variation: There may be seasonal variation in the area covered by intertidal seagrass beds, as plants die back during cold temperatures in winter.

Sediment is formed of fine sand, muddy sands and mud according to the course of the river bed. Surface salinity is low (0.03 to 2,5 for the Rhône) whereas that of the deep layer, in contact with the benthic fauna, is much higher (16 to 21 for the Rhône). A marine salty patch can be seen sunk underneath the fresh water of the river. Tides are weak and only cause minor changes in the water’s chlorinity. The winds have a more marked influence on the position of the salty patch. When parts of the estuary or the estuary lagoons are cut off, either naturally or by human action, the salinity of the water may increase considerably.\r\nPopulation variations are linked to the topography of the bed, which causes a differential distribution of the various types of sediment, and to anthropic action. These are especially reflected in the size of species populations, which varies with granulometry but can also be greatly reduced when anthropic action is too great. In the absence of the tide effect, the transition is rapid between the (freshwater) limnic environment and the marine environment. Thus there is no gradient in the distribution of the fauna, which occurs patchily. The species present are characterised by very rapid cycles of development that permit accelerated reconquest of the environments."

      "habitat_description": "Rocky habitats in the infralittoral zone dominated by kelp and seaweeds.\r\nIn areas exposed to extremely exposed wave action or strong tidal streams, typically the rock supports a community of kelp Laminaria hyperborea with foliose seaweeds and animals, the latter tending to become more prominent in areas of strongest water movement (MB1-213, MB1-215 and MB1-2152). The depth to which the kelp extends varies according to water clarity, exceptionally (e.g. St Kilda) reaching 45 m. In some areas, there may be a band of dense foliose seaweeds (reds or browns) below the main kelp zone (MB1-221). The sublitttoral fringe is characterised by dabberlocks Alaria esculenta (MB1-211). In very strong wave action the sublittoral fringe A. esculenta zone extends to 5 to 10 m depth, whilst at Rockall A. esculenta replaces L. hyperborea as the dominant kelp in the infralittoral zone (MB1-212).              \r\nSituation: Very exposed rocky coasts, from low water to depths up to 45m.           \r\nTemporal variation: Winter storms may remove patches of kelp, and fast-growing annuals may form a temporary forest (MB1-232).           \r\nOn bedrock and stable boulders subject to moderate wave exposure, or moderately strong tidal streams there is typically a narrow band of kelp Laminaria digitata in the sublittoral fringe which lies above a Laminaria hyperborea forest and park. Associated with the kelp are communities of seaweeds, predominantly reds and including a greater variety of more delicate filamentous types than found on more exposed coasts (A3.11). The faunal component of the understorey is also less prominant than in A3.11.         \r\nOn sheltered infralittoral rock exposed to strong tidal streams in the sublittoral fringe, dense Laminaria digitata is found together with erect seaweeds, sponges, ascidians and bryozoans (MB1-21E). Below this, on bedrock and stable boulders a canopy of mixed kelp (primarily Laminaria hyperborea and Laminaria saccharina ) occurs with foliose red seaweeds, sponges and ascidians (MB1-21F). This biotope is typically found in the sheltered narrows and sills of Scottish sealochs. Mixed substrata of boulders, cobbles, pebbles and gravel, that also occurs in the tidal rapids of Scottish sealochs, supports a reduced kelp canopy ( L. hyperborea and L. saccharina ; typically Frequent), with a rich red seaweed component and maerl at some sites (MB1-21G). In south-west Britain, sheltered, tide-swept rock is restricted to estuarine conditions where variable salinity and increased turbidity of the water have a significant effect on the biota, limiting the infralittoral zone to very shallow depths. Unlike the tide-swept channels in sealochs, the rock in these estuaries is characterised by a relatively low abundance of L. saccharina (< Common) with foliose red seaweeds, sponges and ascidians (A3.224). L. hyperborea is rarely present."

The kelp Laminaria digitata is usually absent, although stunted plants may be present at a few sites. The limpet Patella vulgata and the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides are often common. Patches of anthozoans and the hydroid Tubularia spp. occur in more wave-surged areas. In extremely exposed areas the A. esculenta zone can extend as deep as 15 m, where it has less S. balanoides, M. edulis and greater densities of Tubularia spp. (e.g. Barra and shallow areas of Rockall, Scotland).           \r\nSituation: This biotope is most commonly found beneath the mussel-barnacle zone (unit MA1-221) of very exposed shores and above the upper infralittoral Laminaria hyperborea forest ( MB1-213 or MB1-213). It is at the extremely wave-surged sites, such as St Kilda, that MB1-213 occurs below MB1-2111. Occasionally, the A. esculenta zone occurs below a narrow but dense band of red seaweeds: typically Mastocarpus stellatus and/or Palmaria palmata and Corallina officinalis (unit MA1-235) or very occasionally Himanthalia elongata (MA1-233). A dense turf of C. officinalis (MA1-232) occurs above the A. esculenta zone at a few extremely exposed sites, particularly on steep or vertical rock. On less exposed shores, however, an A. esculenta dominated zone may lie immediately above a narrow L. digitata zone (MB1-2112). Unit MB1-2111 can also occur on less exposed steep or vertical shores, where wave-surge restricts the growth of L. digitata which generally dominates the sublittoral fringe rock on moderately exposed shores. On seasonally unstable boulders or sites subject to disturbance by strong wave-action, a mixed kelp canopy that characterises MB1-232 may occur beneath the MB1-2111 zone instead of the ubiquitous L. hyperborea forest; this is most common on the Shetland isles.            \r\nTemporal variation: At very exposed sites, A. esculenta may have been so wave-battered during the season as to be reduced to a tattered midrib with no blades, altering the general appearance of the biotope. Where MB1-2111 occurs on boulders and/or sites subject to disturbance during severe weather conditions, rock that is scoured clean may then be rapidly colonised by fast-growing green algae such as Enteromorpha spp. An assemblage of rapidly colonising species that characterise the disturbed MB1-231 biotope may also develop in the sublittoral fringe. A species that can fluctuate in huge numbers at these sites is the starfish Asterias rubens, sometimes forming dense aggregations across the narrow A. esculenta band whilst feeding on the mussels."

Also found on the stipes or on the rock below the canopy are red seaweeds including Phycodrys rubens, Kallymenia reniformis, Callophyllis laciniata, Caryophyllia smithii, and Corallina officinalis, while encrusting coralline algae can cover any bare patches of rock. At some sites the red seaweeds can be virtually mono-specific, while at other sites show considerable variation containing a dense mixed turf of a large variety of species. The red seaweed Odonthalia dentata can be present in the north. The faunal and floral under-storey is generally rich in species due, in part, to the relatively low urchin-grazing pressure in such shallow exposed conditions. The faunal composition of this biotope varies markedly between sites, but commonly occurring are the soft coral Alcyonium digitatum and the anthozoans Sagartia elegans and Corynactis viridis. Sponges form a prominent part of the community with variable amounts of the sponges Halichondria panicea and Pachymatisma johnstonia and several other species. The crab Cancer pagurus and the starfish Asterias rubens are normally present in small numbers foraging beneath the canopy, while the sea urchins Echinus esculentus and Urticina felina graze on the seaweeds. The hydroid Obelia geniculata, the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri and the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea compete for space on the kelp, whereas the bryozoan Electra pilosa also can be found on foliose red seaweeds.      \r\nSituation: This kelp forest most commonly occurs beneath a zone of Alaria  esculenta and Mytilus edulis (unit MB1-2111) and may contain small patches of A. esculenta.

      "habitat_description": "Very exposed to exposed upper infralittoral bedrock or large boulders characterised by a dense forest of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea. On the rock surface beneath the kelp canopy is a dense turf of red foliose seaweeds including Cryptopleura ramosa, Plocamium cartilagineum, Phycodrys rubens and Callophyllis laciniata as well as encrusting coralline algae and the foliose brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma. The red algal turf can be virtually mono-specific, dominated by stands of P. cartilagineum, C. ramosa or Heterosiphonia plumosa, Kallymenia reniformis or in the north, Odonthalia dentata. Other sites may contain a dense mixed turf of these and other species. The dense turf is due, in part, to the relatively low grazing pressure from the urchin Echinus esculentus in such shallow exposed conditions. The shallowest kelp plants are often short or stunted, while deeper plants are taller and the stipes are heavily epiphytised by red seaweeds such as Delesseria sanguinea and Membranoptera alata. The bryozoan Electra pilosa can form colonies on the foliose red seaweeds, while the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea more often can be found on the L. hyperborea fronds along with the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri and the hydroid Obelia geniculata. The gastropods Gibbula cineraria and Calliostoma zizyphinum are found grazing among the kelp holdfasts, while a few individuals of the barnacle Balanus crenatus can present along with the white calcareous tubes of the polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter, where substratum is available. The starfish Asterias rubens can be found predating on polychaetes, mussels and small crustaceans. The soft coral Alcyonium digitatum can be present covering the rock surface as well as the anthozoan Urticina felina.                            \r\nSituation: This kelp forest biotope most commonly occurs beneath a zone of Alaria esculenta/Mytilus edulis (unit MB1-2111) and above a L. hyperborea park (unit MB1-2152). At very exposed sites, such as some areas of Shetland and St Kilda, the lower infralittoral zone is often characterised by a park of Laminaria saccharina and/or Saccorhiza polyschides (MB1-232). This zone presumably develops due to the mobility of nearby cobbles, boulders and sediment during winter storms, removing the slower growing L. hyperborea. Occasionally, a band of dense foliose seaweeds, with no kelp, occurs below the kelp forest (units MB1-221 or MB1-2211)."

      "habitat_description": "Very exposed to exposed lower infralittoral bedrock or large boulders characterised by a kelp park of Laminaria hyperborea with a dense turf of foliose red seaweeds and encrusting coralline algae. These red seaweeds dominate kelp stipes and bedrock in a similar abundance and composition to the upper infralittoral kelp forest, the most commonly occurring species being Callophyllis laciniata, Cryptopleura ramosa, Plocamium cartilagineum, Kallymenia reniformis, Delesseria sanguinea, Phycodrys rubens, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Heterosiphonia plumosa and Bonnemaisonia asparagoides. In addition, moderate to high abundance of foliose brown seaweeds, such as Dictyota dichotoma are more common than in the kelp forest above. More upper circalittoral fauna occur in the park than in the kelp forest, such as the cup-coral Caryophyllia smithii. Some species more often present in the kelp park than the forest include the anthozoan Alcyonium digitatum and the featherstar Antedon bifida. The urchin Echinus esculentus, the gastropods Gibbula cineraria and Calliostoma zizyphinum and the starfish Asterias rubens are normally present underneath the canopy along with the anthozoans Urticina felina and Corynactis viridis. The sponge Cliona celata is also present often found boring into shells or soft rock where available. The bryozoan Membranipora membranacea can be found on the L. hyperborea fronds along with the hydroid Obelia geniculata and the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri. The polychaete Pomatoceros sp. is present on the rock surface.       \r\nSituation: This biotope usually occurs below the exposed kelp forests (units MB1-213 and MB1-2151). At some sites, a dense band of D. dichotoma may form a separate zone below (MB1-221). Where seasonally unstable cobbles and/or boulders are present adjacent to and/or below the bedrock supporting the L. hyperborea unit MB1-232 may occur.                        \r\nTemporal variation: In the late summer both the kelp and the foliose seaweeds can become heavily encrusted with the bryozoan crusts Electra pilosa and Membranipora membranacea. Temporal variation within the community structure is unknown."

      "habitat_description": "Mixed Laminaria hyperborea and Laminaria ochroleuca forests on upper infralittoral exposed rock with a dense community of foliose red seaweeds such as Cryptopleura ramosa, and Plocamium cartilagineum as well as small filamentous red seaweeds including Bonnemaisonia asparagoides, Heterosiphonia plumosa, Pterosiphonia parasitica and Brongniartella byssoides. L. hyperborea has a rough stipe which allow dense assemblages of epiphytic red seaweeds to form including the foliose Callophyllis laciniata, Delesseria sanguinea and Hypoglossum hypoglossoides. Unlike L. hyperborea, however, L. ochroleuca has a smooth stipe and so it lacks dense assemblages of epiphytic seaweeds L. ochroleuca has a smooth stipe. Encrusting coralline algae often cover much of the rock surface along with a few brown seaweeds including Dictyota dichotoma, Dictyopteris polypodioides and Desmarestia aculeata present as well. In mixed kelp forest L. ochroleuca may predominate with L. hyperborea more common at shallower depths. Whilst foliose red seaweeds dominate the upward-facing rock beneath the kelp canopy, much of the fauna is restricted to crevices or vertical faces, possibly due to grazing pressure. Echinoderms are often common in this biotope, in particular the sea urchin Echinus esculentus and the starfish Asterias rubens and Marthasterias glacialis. Verticals are colonised by anthozoans including the anthozoans Corynactis viridis, Caryophyllia smithii, Actinothoe sphyrodeta and Alcyonium digitatum, while the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea colonise the Laminaria sp. fronds. This biotope is restricted to the coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. L. ochroleuca occurs at low abundance in other kelp biotopes (sheltered through to exposed) from Dorset to Lundy Island. In such cases, records should be treated as regional variations of these biotopes. Records should only be assigned to this unit when the canopy is dominated by L. ochroleuca alone, or (more usually) by a mixture of both L. hyperborea and L. ochroleuca (at similar abundance). Both this biotope and unit MB1-238 are common on the Brittany and Normandy coasts of France.                  \r\nSituation: Since L. ochroleuca is less tolerant of wave action than L. hyperborea this biotope commonly occurs below exposed kelp forests (unit MB1-2151). On occasion it is found below Alaria  esculenta in the sublittoral fringe (units MB1-2111 or MB1-2112). At some sites a band of dense foliose seaweeds, with no kelp, occurs below the kelp forest (MB1-221 or MB1-2211) whilst at other sites L. hyperborea kelp park occurs below (MB1-2152)."

Within this biotope the jewel anemone Corynactis viridis is frequently found in dense aggregations attached to the vertical rock surface. This biotope contains 5 sub-biotopes, distinguished by their biogeography. On the west coast of Scotland, the Northern Isles and the Isle of Man on extremely exposed coasts a variant of this biotope characterised by frequent Metridium senile and occasional Sagartia elegans can be found. Further south on the west coast of Ireland, southern Scotland, Wales, and south west England a second variant characterised by frequent Alcyonium digitatum and occasional Cliona celata can be distinguished. A third variant has been recorded from Northern Ireland characterised by the red seaweeds Lithophyllum and Ptilota gunneri, the sea squirt Dendrodoa grossularia and the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. South from the Isle of Man, on the Welsh Coast, and on the south west and southern English coasts a fourth variant of this biotope is found, which is characterised by the barnacle Balanus crenatus, which may be more frequent in this sub-biotope, and the rarity of Alcyonium digitatum, a species which is more frequent in other variants. This variant has mainly been recorded in shallow water (0-5m). The final biogeographic variant of this biotope is, as with the previous variant, found on the coasts of Wales and south west England. It can be distinguished from the previous variant by the frequent Diplosoma listerianum and occasional Lissoclinum perforatum, although these species are not always present.           \r\nSituation: Open rocky coasts of the south-west, west and north-west."

The most frequently occurring red seaweeds are Palmaria palmata, Corallina officinalis, Mastocarpus stellatus, Chondrus crispus, Lomentaria articulata and Membranoptera alata. Generally the rocky substratum is covered by encrusting coralline algae, on which occasional limpets Patella vulgata and topshells Gibbula cineraria graze. A wide variety of fauna occurs, some of the most commonly occurring species being the sponge Halichondria panicea and the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter. Kelp holdfasts provide a refuge for a varied assemblage of species such as sponges and the limpet Helcion pellucidum, while encrusting bryozoans such as Electra pilosa more often are found on the fronds of foliose red seaweeds. Solitary ascidians may be locally abundant where overhanging or vertical rock occurs, while the hydroid Dynamena pumila can be abundant on Fucus serratus and Laminaria sp. fronds. On exposed, wave-surged shores, the robust red seaweeds M. stellatus, C. crispus and C. officinalis can form a dense turf beneath the kelp along with the occasional green seaweed Ulva lactuca.

Upper surfaces of the boulders are colonised by dense L. digitata though other kelp such as Laminaria hyperborea and Laminaria saccharina or the wrack Fucus serratus can be present at lower abundance. The kelp fronds can be colonised by the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. Beneath the kelp canopy are a variety of red seaweeds such as Mastocarpus stellatus, Chondrus crispus, Palmaria palmata, Membranoptera alata, Corallina officinalis and coralline crusts. Green seaweeds include Cladophora rupestris and Ulva lactuca. Where space is available beneath the boulders (i.e. they are not buried in sediment) there may be a rich assemblage of animals. Characteristic species include the crabs Porcellana platycheles, Pisidia longicornis and juvenile Cancer pagurus. Also present beneath the boulders are often high densities of the barnacle Balanus crenatus, the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter, spirorbid worms, the polychaete Harmothoe sp., gammarid amphipods and a few gastropods such as Gibbula cineraria. The encrusting bryozoans Electra pilosa and Umbonula littoralis and encrusting colonies of the sponges Halichondria panicea and Halisarca dujardini are also typical of this habitat.

Filamentous red seaweeds often present are Polysiphonia fucoides and Ceramium nodulosum, while coralline crusts cover available rock surface. The bryozoan Membranipora membranacea and the hydroid Dynanema pumila can form colonies on the kelp fronds, while the bryozoan Electra pilosa more often occur on the foliose red seaweeds. Empty piddock burrows are often colonised by the polychaete Sabellaria spinulosa or in more shaded areas the sponges Halichondria panicea and Hymeniacidon perleve. The undersides of small chalk boulders are colonised by encrusting bryozoans, colonial ascidians and the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros lamarcki. The boulders and any crevices within the chalk provide a refuge for small crustaceans such as Carcinus maenas, the mussel Mytilus edulis or the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. The echinoderm Asterias rubens is present as well.           \r\nSituation: This biotope occurs on moderately exposed soft rock where unit MB1-2171 would normally occur. Above it may lie a zone of Fucus serratus on similarly bored soft rock (unit MA1-2443) or a variant of one of the F. serratus biotopes (e.g. MA1-2441). Lower shore sites influenced by sand may have more Mytilus edulis beneath the seaweed canopy (MA1-247) or the sand-binding red seaweed Rhodothamniella floridula (MA1-245). Below this biotope a variety of biotopes can occur such as MB1-233 on unstable infralittoral cobbles and boulders or even MC1-251 in the turbid waters of south-east England where the kelp generally extends to less than 4m BCD.          \r\nTemporal variation: The under-storey of foliose and filamentous seaweeds will diminish towards the autumn and regrow in the spring. Since the soft rock does not provide a strong hold for the seaweeds they are easily dislodged during storm periods. After such an event the green seaweeds Enteromorpha spp. and Ulva spp. and/or the red seaweed P. palmata may temporarily cover much of the rock. Eventually a more diverse range of seaweeds and associated animals will re-establish on the rock."

Some red seaweeds can be found as epiphytes on the kelp stipes and include Delesseria sanguinea and Phycodrys rubens. Other red seaweeds present include the Plocamium cartilagineum, Callophyllis laciniata, Cryptopleura ramosa and the brown seaweeds Dictyota dichotoma and Cutleria multifida. The kelp fronds can be colonised by the hydroid Obelia geniculata or the bryozoans Membranipora membranacea. The echinoderm Antedon bifida, the ascidian Clavelina lepadiformis, the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter, the anthozoans Alcyonium digitatum and Urticina felina can be found on the rock beneath the canopy. Mobile species often present include the gastropods Gibbula cineraria and Calliostoma zizyphinum and the echinoderms Echinus esculentus and Asterias rubens. Five variants has been described: Kelp forest (unit MB1-21A1), kelp park (unit MB1-21A2), grazed kelp forest (unit MB1-21A3), grazed kelp park (unit MB1-21A4) and kelp with Sabellaria spinulosa reefs (unit MB1-21A5). This suite of biotopes differs from the wave exposed L. hyperborea biotopes by having a lower diversity of cushion-forming faunal species. The foliose red seaweed component of the two suites of biotopes may also differ in composition with a tendency for MB1-21A to include some more delicate filamentous species."

      "habitat_description": "Moderately exposed upper infralittoral bedrock and boulders characterised by a dense forest of Laminaria hyperborea with dense foliose red seaweeds beneath the canopy. These include Callophyllis laciniata, Plocamium cartilagineum, Cryptopleura ramosa and Delesseria sanguinea. Kelp stipes are usually covered in a rich mixture of red seaweeds of which Palmaria palmata, Phycodrys rubens and Membranoptera alata are often present. Small kelp plants can also be found on the larger kelp stipes. Kelp fronds may be covered with a hydroid growth of Obelia geniculata or the bryozoans Membranipora membranacea and Electra pilosa. The kelp holdfasts can be colonised by bryozoans Scrupocellaria spp. and/or crisiids and colonial ascidians such as Botryllusschlosseri. The rock surface between the kelp plants is generally covered by encrusting coralline algae, often with sponge crusts Halichondria panicea. Small vertical surfaces within the kelp forest generally lack kelp plants, instead being characterised by foliose red seaweeds such as Dictyota dichotoma, the anthozoans Alcyoniumdigitatum, Urticina felina and Caryophyllia smithii, the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter and gastropods including Calliostoma zizyphinum and Gibbula cineraria. Many grazers are found in the kelp forest, the most commonly occurring being the gastropods Gibbula cineraria and Calliostoma zizyphinum and the echinoderm Echinus esculentus. Other echinoderms present include Asterias rubens and Antedon bifida which can be locally abundant, particularly in the north-west.           \r\nSituation: This biotope occurs over a wide geographic area and is generally found below the sublittoral fringe Laminaria digitata zone (unit MB1-23A1) and above the L. hyperborea park (unit MB1-21A2). In the north, Shetland in particular, unit MB1-232 can occur in the lower infralittoral; where grazing influence is present the abundance of red seaweeds may be much reduced (unit MB1-21A4). In turbid water kelp park is often absent and dense foliose seaweed cover may occur instead (unit MB1-21B). In areas affected by scour, such as the rock-sediment interface at the base of bedrock slopes, a mixed kelp canopy can develop below the kelp forest (unit MB1-235).          \r\nTemporal variation: The under-storey of foliose and filamentous seaweeds will diminish towards the autumn and regrow in the spring. Otherwise this biotope is not known to vary markedly over time. Certain areas are prone to urchin grazing and this can substantially alter the community structure of the biotope, such that any site subject to intensive urchin grazing should be recorded as unit MB1-21A3."

      "habitat_description": "Below the dense kelp forest (unit MB1-21A1) on moderately exposed lower infralittoral bedrock and boulders, the kelp thins out to form a park. Beneath the kelp, the rock and kelp stipes are covered by an often dense turf of foliose red seaweeds such as Callophyllis laciniata, Plocamium cartilagineum, Delesseria sanguinea, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Cryptopleura ramosa, Callophyllis laciniata and Phycodrys rubens. Coralline crusts are often present on the rock surface. Many species of red seaweed found in this biotope occur at greater abundance in the shallower kelp forest. Other seaweeds, such as the red seaweeds Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Hypoglossum hypoglossoides as well as the brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma are more abundant in this zone than the upper infralittoral. The faunal component of this biotope is similar to that found below the kelp in the upper infralittoral zone and include the hydroid Obelia geniculata, the ascidian Clavelina lepadiformis, the anthozoans Urticina felina, Alcyonium digitatum and Caryophyllia smithii, the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter and the gastropods Calliostoma zizyphinum and Gibbula cineraria. The gastropods Gibbula cineraria and Calliostoma zizyphinum and the echinoderm Echinus esculentus can be found grazing on the rock. Other echinoderms present include Asterias rubens and Antedon bifida which can be locally abundant, particularly in the north-west.           \r\nSituation: This biotope generally occurs below L. hyperborea forest (unit MB1-21A1) and marks the lower limit of the infralittoral rock. Occasionally a narrow band of foliose seaweeds (unit MB1-221) may occur below the kelp park but generally circalittoral biotopes are found.      \r\nTemporal variation: The under-storey of foliose and filamentous seaweeds will diminish towards the autumn and regrow in the spring. When grazing urchins (predominantly E. esculentus) reach a large number in the kelp park their voracious grazing can substantially alter the community structure of the biotope, removing most of the seaweeds and leaving only coralline crusts on the rock. This is common around the coast of Scotland, particularly in Shetland and such sites should be recorded as unit MB1-21A3."

      "habitat_description": "Exposed to moderately exposed Laminaria hyperborea forest is in some areas intensely grazed by the urchin Echinus esculentus. The rock surface lacks a significant turf of foliose seaweeds and generally looks bare, though encrusting algae cover the rock. In addition to these encrusting coralline algae, non-calcareous crusts such as Cruoria pellita and brown algal crusts also occur. The kelp stipes may or may not be grazed; in the most extremely grazed areas, the stipes are also devoid of seaweeds. More usually, however, the stipes offers a refuge from grazing, and are characterised by dense turfs of red seaweeds, especially Phycodrys rubens, Callophyllis laciniata, Plocamium cartilagineum and Delesseria sanguinea. The hydroid Obelia geniculata and the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea colonise the kelp fronds. On the rock itself certain brown seaweeds such as Cutleria multifida may persist in this grazed environment. Fast-growing species such as the kelp Laminaria saccharina may be present at sites recovering from grazing, opportunistically colonising the rock surfaces that have been cleared by grazing. The fauna within a grazed kelp forest is also relatively sparse and is mostly confined to cracks, crevices and under-boulders. Species such as the ascidian Clavelina lepadiformis can often be found on vertical rock. Also found on the rock surface are the anthozoans Urticina felina and Alcyonium digitatum. Encrusting species such as the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter are resistant to grazing and may occur in abundance. The grazers present include the echinoderm Echinus esculentus and the gastropods Calliostoma zizyphinum and Gibbula cineraria. Other echinoderms present include Asterias rubens and Antedon bifida which can be abundant in the north-west. Moderate grazing occurs within many kelp forests; records should only be assigned to this biotope where the community has been intensively grazed leaving algal-encrusted rock with very few epilithic algae.       \r\nSituation: With increasing depth, the kelp forest grades into a grazed kelp park (unit MB1-21A4), the lower limit of which is often abrupt, representing the balance point between urchin-grazing pressure and kelp growth capabilities. In wave-exposed steep rocky areas, the shallowest water may be characterised by a forest of kelp with red seaweeds (unit MB1-2151), with a grazed kelp forest beneath. This effect may be a result of the increased wave action in shallower water, which regularly dislodges the urchins thereby reducing their grazing impact. This unit is prevalent in the north of the UK where E. esculentus populations reach high densities. Although E. esculentus is widely distributed around the UK it occurs in greatest abundance in Scotland and north-east England where urchin grazing can substantially affect infralittoral communities.           \r\nTemporal variation: Fluctuations in E. esculentus numbers may give foliose seaweeds a chance to re-grow periodically. Further information is required on the temporal variation within these grazed forests and the changes in community structure when grazing pressure decreases."

The stable rock, which can be cobbles or boulders but is more typically bedrock, is usually silted. Individual species of foliose red seaweeds such as Plocamium cartilagineum or Calliblepharis ciliata often dominate. Other red seaweeds likely to be present include Phyllophora crispa, Rhodymenia holmesii, Halurus flosculosus, Cryptopleura ramosa, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Heterosiphonia plumosa and coralline crusts. The brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma is sometimes present, although never abundant. This biotope does not generally occur below kelp park but rather occurs on shallow, silted rock on which kelp would normally grow in less turbid conditions. The fauna can be variable but is generally typified by the presence of silt-tolerant animals such as encrusting sponges, particularly Dysidea fragilis and Halichondria panicea, the hydroid Tubularia indivisa, bryozoan crusts and scattered Sabellaria spinulosa and Balanus crenatus. In the summer months the seaweeds can become heavily encrusted with the bryozoan Electra pilosa and the ascidian Molgula manhattensis which can also form dense mats on the rock. The polychaete Lanice conchilega can be present, where sandy and muddy patches occur. Where this biotope occurs on chalk bedrock, such as off the Sussex coast, the piddock Pholas dactylus is often found bored into the rock. This biotope is recorded from the English Channel, off Kent, Sussex and the Isle of Wight. Please notice that individual sites of this biotope can vary significantly in the species composition.\r\nSituation: This biotope generally occurs on discrete bedrock outcrops surrounded by areas of mixed sediment or mobile sand. Off Sussex, it occurs on the horizontal chalk bedrock forming the tops of cliffs (2-3m in height).             \r\nTemporal variation: The seaweeds die back in late autumn and summer leaving, silted, coralline-encrusted rock with a sparse fauna of sponges, S. spinulosa and occasional hydroids and bryozoans. The bryozoan Amathia lendigera can also become abundant amongst the seaweeds during the summer months."

Although L. hyperborea (typically Common) generally occurs in greater abundance than L. saccharina (Frequent), either kelp may dominate, sometimes to the exclusion of the other. (This biotope should not be confused with sheltered, but silted MB1-239). Large stands of the brown seaweed Halidrys siliquosa may also occur amongst the kelp along with Dictyota dichotoma on bedrock and boulders. In contrast to the scoured rock surface the kelp stipes themselves often support prolific growths of foliose red seaweeds such as Phycodrys rubens, Membranoptera alata, Delesseria sanguinea and Plocamium cartilagineum.

      "habitat_description": "Sheltered, tide-swept rock in south-western Britain tends to be restricted to estuarine conditions, where variable salinity and increased turbidity have a significant effect on the biota. Due to the turbidity of the water, the infralittoral zone is restricted to very shallow depths. Unlike the tide-swept channels in sealochs, which support a mixed kelp canopy, the rock in these estuaries is characterised by Laminaria saccharina alone, occurring in relatively low abundance (Frequent). The brown alga Desmarestia ligulata can occur in this biotope, though never dense, along with the non-native brown seaweed Sargassum muticum. Beneath the sparse kelp, cobbles and boulders, often surrounded by sediment, are encrusted by fauna and often a dense turf of red seaweed. The foliose red seaweeds associated with this biotope include Callophyllis laciniata, Nitophyllum punctatum, Kallymenia reniformis, Gracilaria gracilis, Gymnogongrus crenulatus, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Rhodophyllis divaricata, Chylocladia verticillata, Cryptopleura ramosa and Erythroglossum laciniatum as well as the filamentous Ceramium nodulosum and Pterothamnion plumula. Green seaweeds Ulva lactuca, Bryopsis plumosa and Cladophora spp. may be locally abundant. The dominating faunal species vary from site to site but include sponges such as Halichondria panicea, Esperiopsis fucorum, Dysidea fragilis and Hymeniacidon perleve as well as ascidians, particularly Dendrodoa grossularia and Morchellium argus, which can cover the rocks. Also present is the anthozoan Anemonia viridis, the barnacle Balanus crenatus and the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter. The hydroid Plumularia setacea can cover rocks and seaweed fronds Of the range of solitary ascidians found in the north-west, only Ascidiella aspersa tends also to be present in these south-western inlets. There is also a general absence of echinoderms. Where there is vertical rock present, it tends to support more fauna, including barnacles Balanus crenatus, the ascidians Clavelina lepadiformis and Botryllus schlosseri and sometines the featherstar Antedon bifida. Where soft rock allows, such as the limestone in Plymouth Sound, rock-boring organisms such as Polydora sp. may be locally abundant. Sheltered, tide-swept rock is generally restricted to the narrows or tidal rapids of marine inlets. The clear tide-swept waters of Scottish sealochs are significantly different to the marine inlets of south-west Britain. This biotope deals with the latter.     \r\nSituation: This biotope generally occurs on rocky outcrops interspersed by sediment areas. Where the rock extends into deeper water, beyond the limit of kelp, sponges and ascidians tend to dominate these sheltered, tide-swept circalittoral sites (MC1-241); also Alcyonium digitatum with sponges and Nemertesia antennina (MC1-213)."

      "habitat_description": "Tide-swept infralittoral rock subject to variable salinity and turbid waters occurs in the mid to upper reaches of the rias of south-west Britain, where riverine freshwater input reduces the salinity. Very shallow rock under these conditions is characterised by a covering of filamentous red seaweed such as Callithamnion spp., Antithamnion spp., Ceramium spp., Griffithsia devoniensis, Pterothamnion plumula and Polysiphonia fucoides, as well as the filamentous green seaweed Cladophora spp. Foliose red seaweeds such as Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Cryptopleura ramosa and Erythroglossum laciniatum commonly occur, as does the foliose green seaweed Ulva lactuca. Although Laminaria saccharina is often present it is usually in very low abundance (Occasional). The fluctuating salinity limits the number of species able to exist in this habitat. The animal community is dominated by the sponges Halichondria panicea and Hymeniacidon perleve and the barnacle Balanus crenatus. The ascidians Clavelina lepadiformis and Dendrodoa grossularia can be locally abundant at some sites. The crab Carcinus maenas is usually present, as is the mussel Mytilus edulis. The bryozoan Bugula plumosa is sometimes present. Where vertical rock is present, the seaweeds Ceramium nodulosum, P. plumula, C. ramosa, H. hypoglossoides and E. laciniatum are typically found.    \r\nSituation: This biotope is usually found amidst sediment or rock and as such there is no defined zonation of the surrounding biotopes. Shallow sediments nearby may support seagrass beds ( Zostera spp.) or infaunal-dominated sediments (unit MB3-2). Nearby, deeper tide-swept rock may support circalittoral communities dominated by sponges, hydroids and ascidians on stable rock (unit MC1-2411) or dense bryozoans on mixed substrata (units MC1-217 & MC1-219)."

Most of the red seaweeds are common to the kelp zone above, while the faunal component of the biotope is made up of species that are found either in the kelp zone or the animal-dominated upper circalittoral below. Foliose species commonly present include Dilsea carnosa, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Schottera nicaeensis, Cryptopleura ramosa and Delesseria sanguinea. The red seaweed species composition varies considerably; at some sites a single species may dominate (particularly Plocamium cartilagineum). Small filamentous red seaweeds can be found here as well. These include species such as Heterosiphonia plumosa, Brongniartella byssoides. As well as a varied red seaweed component, this biotope may also contain occasional kelp plants and patches of the brown foliose seaweed Dictyota dichotoma. Coralline crusts covers the bedrock beneath the seaweeds. The fauna generally comprises low-encrusting forms such as the tubeworms Pomatoceros spp., anthozoans including Alcyonium digitatum, Urticina felina and Caryophyllia smithii) and occasional sponge crusts such as Cliona celata, Esperiopsis fucorum, Scypha ciliata and Dysidea fragilis. More mobile fauna include the gastropod Calliostoma zizyphinum, the echinoderms Echinus esculentus as well as the starfish Asterias rubens and Marthasterias glacialis and lastly, the crab Cancer pagurus. Bryozoan crusts such as Electra pilosa can be found fronds on the foliose red seaweeds while scattered hydroids such as Nemertesia antennina form colonies on shells, cobbles and available rock. At some sites erect bryozoans Crisia spp. and Bugula spp. are present. Ascidians such as Clavelina lepadiformis and Clavelina lepadiformis may also be common.

      "habitat_description": "Exposed low-lying reefs in the sublittoral fringe or upper infralittoral (generally above 5m depth), mainly in the southwest and west, dominated by the kelp Saccorhiza polyschides. This opportunistic coloniser replaces Laminaria digitata or Laminaria hyperborea as the dominant kelp, following 'disturbance' of the canopy. This may be the result of storms, when loose sediment and even cobbles or boulders are mobilised, scouring most seaweeds and animals from the surrounding rock. As S. polyschides is essentially a summer annual (occasionally it lasts into a second year), it is also particularly common close to rock/sand interfaces which become too scoured during winter months to prevent the longer-living kelps from surviving. As a result of the transient nature of this biotope, its composition is varied; it may contain several other kelp species, including L. digitata, Laminaria saccharina and Alaria esculenta, at varying abundances. Laminaria spp. sporelings can also be a prominent feature of the site. Beneath the kelp, (scour-tolerant) red seaweeds including Corallina officinalis, Kallymenia reniformis, Plocamium cartilagineum, Chondrus crispus, Dilsea carnosa and encrusting coralline algae are often present. Foliose red seaweeds such as Callophyllis laciniata, Cryptopleura ramosa and Palmaria palmata also occur in this biotope. P. palmata and Delesseria sanguinea often occur as epiphytes on the stipes of L. hyperborea, when it is present. The foliose green seaweed Ulva spp. is fast to colonise newly cleared areas of rock and is often present along with the foliose brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma. Due to the disturbed nature of this biotope, fauna are generally sparse, being confined to encrusting bryozoans and/or sponges, such as Halichondria panicea and the gastropod Gibbula cineraria.         \r\nSituation: On some shores (for example in Cornwall and south-west Ireland), S. polyschides competes so effectively with the other laminarians that it forms a well-defined zone in shallow water, between the L. digitata (unit MB1-23A1) and L. hyperborea zones (units MB1-213 and MB1-21A). Elsewhere, it is found at sites that have been physically disturbed, removing areas of established kelp (L. hyperborea) thus allowing this opportunistic biotope to develop over a short space of time.                \r\nTemporal variation: There may be significant variations in this biotope over time, as by its very nature, it is dominated by many fast-growing annual seaweeds. The foliose green seaweed Ulva sp. is fast to colonise newly cleared areas of rock and can be present as a dense growth on the rock around the Saccorhiza polyschides. Similarly, large patches of Laminaria spp. sporelings may be present at times."

      "habitat_description": "A forest or park of the fast-growing, opportunistic kelps Laminaria saccharina and/or Saccorhiza polyschides often occurs on seasonally unstable boulders or sand/pebble scoured infralittoral rock. The substratum varies from large boulders in exposed areas to smaller boulders and cobbles in areas of moderate wave exposure or nearby bedrock. In these cases, movement of the substratum during winter storms prevents a longer-lived forest of Laminaria hyperborea from becoming established. This biotope also develops on bedrock where it is affected by its close proximity to unstable substrata. Other fast-growing brown seaweeds such as Desmarestia viridis, Desmarestia aculeata, Cutleria multifida and Dictyota dichotoma are often present. Some L. hyperborea plants may occur in this biotope, but they are typically small since the plants do not survive many years. The kelp stipes are usually epiphytised by red seaweeds such as Delesseria sanguinea and Phycodrys rubens. Other red seaweeds present beneath the kelp canopy include Plocamium cartilagineum, Nitophyllum punctatum, Callophyllis laciniata and Cryptopleura ramosa. Encrusting algae often form a prominent cover on the rock surfaces, including red, brown and coralline crusts. Faunal richness and diversity is generally low compared to the more stable L. hyperborea kelp forest and park communities (MB1-213). Where some protection is afforded the anthozoan Alcyonium digitata can occur in addition to the more robust species such as the tube-building worm Pomatoceros triqueter. Mobile species include the to shell Gibbula cineraria and Calliostoma zizyphinum and the sea urchin Echinus esculentus. The hydroid Obelia geniculata and the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea can often be found colonising the kelp fronds.             \r\nSituation: This biotope can be found below the L. hyperborea zone (units MB1-213 or MB1-213), especially where close to a rock/ sand interface (where it is subject to sand/pebble scour in winter). Where this biotope occurs on bedrock, not scoured by mobile sediment, it is thought to occur as a result of intense wave action in winter storms which is too severe to allow L. hyperborea to develop and remain in shallow water.   \r\nTemporal variation: Due to the disturbed nature of this biotope there can be significant changes in the structure of the community. Coralline and brown algal crusts with sparse kelp plants generally dominate areas that have been recently disturbed. Diversity is low and a few species of fast-growing seaweeds can dominate the seabed. A longer established community will have larger, mixed kelp plants and a greater diversity of red seaweeds."

The brown seaweed Desmarestia aculeata is also typical of this disturbed environment as well encrusting coralline algae and brown crusts. Beneath the prolific growth of C. filum, red and brown seaweeds densely cover many of the boulders, cobbles and pebbles. Other sediment-tolerant seaweeds such as species from the Ectocarpales (brown filamentous seaweeds) and the red seaweeds Chondrus crispus, Phyllophora pseudoceranoides, Dilsea carnosa and Corallina officinalis is normally present. Other red seaweeds which can be found here include Chondria dasyphylla, Brongniartella byssoides, Polysiphonia elongata, Ceramium nodolosum, Cystoclonium purpureum, Heterosiphonia plumosa, Rhodomela confervoides and Plocamium cartilagineum. The brown seaweeds Punctaria sp. and Cladostephus spongiosus are generally present. The faunal component of this biotope is typically sparse - the starfish Asterias rubens and the crabs Pagurus bernhardus and Necora puber are amongst the most conspicuous animals. The bryozoan crust Electra pilosa colonise many of the algae along with the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri. Occasional the polychaete Lanice conchilega may occur in the sand between pebbles, and the anthozoan Urticina felina may be found amongst pockets of gravel along with the gastropod Gibbula cineraria. At some sites the rock beneath the algae can be occupied by the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter. This biotope is also present at other open coast sites around the UK where suitable shallow, seasonally stable boulders, cobbles and pebbles occur. Typical examples of this biotope occur on the shallowest areas of the Sarns in Cardigan Bay, Wales, where reef crests are formed by embedded and mobile boulders, together with cobbles and pebbles in between (typically at 2-3m depth).              \r\nSituation: This biotope occurs in shallow water, often on the crest of an infralittoral boulder/cobble bank and as such will not have any biotope 'above' it. More mobile areas of smaller boulders, cobbles and pebbles nearby may support dense ephemeral red seaweeds (unit MA4-21) or robust scour-tolerant red seaweeds on sand-covered rock (unit MB1-237). The Halidrys siliquosa biotope (unit MB1-236) also thrives under similar conditions, extending deeper than the shallow MB1-233 biotope. Deeper still in the circalittoral zone encrusting fauna is found on highly mobile mixed substrata (MC3-211). At a few sites, this biotope can occur within more extensive maerl beds (MB3-22) but more commonly is surrounded by sandy sediments (MB5-2).                  \r\nTemporal variation: This biotope will change markedly with the seasons. During the winter months boulders and cobbles will be storm battered and overturned and much of the biota dislodged from the rocks. During more stable conditions in the late spring and summer months the fast-growing seaweeds that characterise this biotope (C. filum and L. saccharina in particular) will be quick to re-establish, growing at a phenomenal rate. The seasonal disturbance of the substratum prevents a stable Laminaria hyperborea forest from developing."

The perennial red seaweed Brongniartella byssoides re-grows in the summer months. The L. hyperborea stipes often support a growth of epiphytes, such as Delesseria sanguinea, Phycodrys rubens and Cryptopleura ramosa. The scour can reduce the rock surface to bare coralline crusts at times; sponge crusts and the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri can also grow on the stipes and holdfasts. The faunal diversity on the rock is usually low and restricted to robust, low-profile animals such as the tube-building polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter, the barnacle Balanus crenatus, encrusting bryozoans such as Membranipora membranacea, the anthozoan Urticina felina, the starfish Asterias rubens and the urchin Echinus esculentus. Deeper sites support more hydroids and bryozoans, particularly Bugula spp. Where this biotope occurs in very shallow water Laminaria digitata may be found in combination with the other kelp species.

This is due in part to periods of intense scouring during stormy months, which may strip off all but the most tenacious seaweeds. In addition there will be the natural die back of many of the seaweeds such as B. byssoides and C. ciliata during the winter months which become conspicuous again during the summer months."

The large anthozoan Urticina felina can occur in this biotope but there are few other conspicuous animals.            \r\nSituation: This biotope occurs on shallow sand-covered rock, often below bedrock and boulders supporting kelp forest, which is above the effect of, sand scour (unit MB1-21A) or abutting sand-scoured kelp on bedrock (unit MB1-235). It may also be found adjacent to the shallow kelp and Chorda filum biotope (unit MB1-233) and similarly can be surrounded by a variety of sediment biotopes."

      "habitat_description": "Mixed Laminaria hyperborea and Laminaria ochroleuca forest on upper infralittoral moderately exposed or sheltered rock is restricted to the coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Unlike L. hyperborea, however, L. ochroleuca has a smooth stipe and it lacks the epiphytic growth of seaweeds. The bryozoan Membranipora membranacea may encrust the very lower part of the stipe but the rest of the stipe is characteristically bare. The fronds too are generally free of encrusting hydroids, bryozoans and grazing gastropods as compared to L. hyperborea. L. ochroleuca holdfasts, however, are often encrusted with sponges and colonial ascidians. A large variety of foliose and filamentous red seaweeds are often present underneath the canopy. These include Callophyllis laciniata, Plocamium cartilagineum, Cryptopleura ramosa, Delesseria sanguinea, Dilsea carnosa Bonnemaisonia asparagoides, Erythroglossum laciniatum, Sphaerococcus coronopifolius, Polyneura bonnemaisonii and Corallina officinalis. The foliose brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma is frequently found in this biotope along with the occasional kelp such as Saccorhiza polyschides and Laminaria saccharina. The faunal composition of the biotope as a whole is often sparse. The anthozoans Corynactis viridis and Caryophyllia smithii are common on vertical surfaces with scattered bryozoan turf species such as Crisiidae. Grazers such as the gastropod Gibbula cineraria and the urchin Echinus esculentus are often present. L. ochroleuca occurs across a wide range of wave exposures (in common with L. hyperborea) and consequently it occurs at low abundance in other kelp biotopes (sheltered through to exposed) that occur in the South-West between Dorset to Lundy. In such cases, records should be considered as regional variations of the usual kelp biotopes. Records should only be assigned to this biotope when the canopy is dominated by L. ochroleuca alone, or by a mixture of both L. hyperborea and L. ochroleuca (though the latter is usually at greater abundance). L. ochroleuca commonly occurs on the Brittany and Normandy coasts.              \r\nSituation: On moderately exposed to sheltered rock Laminaria ochroleuca can form a dense forest below the L. hyperborea forest (unit MB1-21A1). At other sites L. hyperborea park (unit MB1-21A2) occurs below MB1-238. A band of dense foliose seaweeds can also dominate the lower infralittoral zone below the kelp zone (MB1-221 or MB1-2211). More data is required to establish further trends in neighbouring biotopes.                       \r\nTemporal variation: The under-storey of foliose and filamentous seaweeds will diminish towards the autumn and regrow in the spring. Otherwise, this biotope is not known to change significantly over time."

In such sheltered conditions, a distinct sublittoral fringe is not always apparent and this biotope can therefore extend from below the Fucus serratus zone (MA1-23F) into the upper infralittoral zone, though there may be a mixed L. saccharina and Laminaria digitata zone (MB1-23A1) in between. There is a relatively low species diversity and species density due to a combination of heavy siltation of the habitat and the lack of light penetrating through the dense kelp canopy. Only a few species of red seaweeds are present compared with MB1-23A1 or MB1-239. The most commonly occurring red seaweeds are Delesseria sanguinea, Phycodrys rubens, Bonnemaisonia hamifera and coralline crusts. Brown seaweeds are also sparse and generally comprise Chorda filum and ectocarpoids. At extremely sheltered sites, where there is a heavy silt cover on the rock and the kelp fronds, the sub-flora is reduced to a few specialised species able to tolerate these conditions, such as the cartilaginous seaweeds Polyides rotundus and Chondrus crispus. Ascidians such as Clavelina lepadiformis, Ascidiella aspersa and Ascidia mentula can remain prominent in such conditions, often occurring on steep or vertical rock which is subject to less siltation. The variety of red seaweeds is further reduced where grazers such as the urchin Echinus esculentus and the top shell Gibbula cineraria are present. The keelworm Pomatoceros triqueter, the crab Carcinus maenas and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus can be present. Geographical variations: Northern sites: in sheltered sealochs the most conspicuous fauna in these forests are the large solitary ascidians Ciona intestinalis, Ascidiella spp. and A. mentula which tend to occur in greater abundance than in the mixed kelp forests (MB1-239). In common with mixed forests, echinoderms are consistently present in low abundance: the featherstar Antedon bifida, common starfish Asterias rubens, the brittlestar Ophiothrix fragilis and the urchin Echinus esculentus are typically present. Saddle oysters Pododesmus patelliformis and chitons Tonicella marmorea can occur in high abundance at some sites. The anthozoan Anemonia viridis is often more prevalent at the extremely sheltered sites. The communities of the sheltered voes and sounds of Shetland and Orkney are similar to those present in the mainland sealochs. Southern sites: Sheltered infralittoral rock is not commonly found outside of the fjordic sealochs. In south-west Britain, where sublittoral rock does occur in shallow marine inlets, the waters are more turbid than in the sealochs, generally limiting kelp to the sublittoral fringe zone. Echinoderms are rare or absent from the south-western L. saccharina forests. A far greater diversity of red seaweeds is associated with the south-western sites: Palmaria palmata, Gracilaria gracilis, Phyllophora pseudoceranoides, Cystoclonium purpureum, Rhodophyllis divaricata, Ceramium nodulosum and Polyneura bonnemaisonii typically occur.                  \r\nSituation: Although this biotope may occur below a mixed kelp canopy that occupies the sublittoral fringe (units MB1-23A1 or MB1-2171) at some sites it extends directly into the sublittoral fringe and abuts the F. serratus zone (MA1-23F or MA1-23F2 on mixed substrata).

During the spring, S. muticum has large quantities of epiphytic ectocarpales and may also support some epifauna e.g. the hydroid Obelia geniculata commonly found on kelp. The brown seaweed Chorda filum, which thrives well on these mixed substrata, is also commonly found with S. muticum during the summer months. In Strangford Lough, where this biotope occurs, the amphipod Dexamine spinosa has been recorded to dominate the epiphytic fauna (this is known to be commonly found in Zostera spp. beds). S. muticum is also found on hard, bedrock substrates within L. saccharina canopies. S. muticum plants on hard substrate area, under a dense L. saccharina canopy, are typically smaller and at a much lower density, especially where a lush, under-storey exists with red seaweeds such as Ceramium nodolosum, Gracilaria gracilis, Chylocladia verticillata, Pterosiphonia plumula and Polysiphonia elongata and the green seaweeds Cladophora sp., Ulva lactuca and Bryopsis plumosa. The anthozoan Anemonia viridis and the crab Necora puber can be present. More information is necessary to validate this description.             \r\nSituation: Where there is a greater proportion of bedrock or boulders (15-100%) L. saccharina will typically dominate the canopy. Areas with pebble cover on a hard substrate are colonised by S. muticum, but individuals quickly become peripatetic and are lost."

      "habitat_description": "Very shallow, heavily-silted infralittoral rock characterised by dense stands of Codium spp., together with silt-tolerant red seaweeds, the green seaweed Ulva spp. and often only a sparse covering of the kelp Laminaria saccharina. This biotope appears to have a restricted distribution, being known at present only from the sheltered voes of Shetland, some Scottish lagoons and from the harbours of south-west England. These locations suggest the habitat is likely to be subject to reduced salinity conditions (although the habitat data indicate mostly fully marine records). Dense Codium spp. can occur at very sheltered sites, on cobbles or boulders, often in dense patches interspersed with filamentous red seaweeds Bonnemaisonia hamifera, Antithamnionella spirographidis and Ceramium spp. Where sediment is present the red seaweed Polyides rotundus is commonly found along the rock-sediment interface, and the sponge Dysidea fragilis often occurs on the rock. Other red seaweeds that may be present include Chondrus crispus, Callophyllis laciniata, Gelidium latifolium, Corallina officinalis and coralline crusts. The brown seaweeds Halidrys siliquosa, Desmarestia viridis or Chorda filum may be present in high abundance and although kelp L. saccharina may occur, it is usually sparse. There are no conspicuous fauna that typify this biotope, though polychaetes such as terebellids and spirorbids may occur. The opisthobranch Elysia viridis may be locally abundant on the seaweeds and is known to favour Codium fragilis in particular. Large stands of Codium sp. (generally Common abundance) are accompanied by red seaweeds such as G. latifolium, C. laciniata and A. spirographidis on the rock beneath. Cod has been reported to occur in the shallows of The Fleet, Bembridge Ledges, Pagham Harbour and Jersey (Tittley et al. 1985). In Ireland, species-poor shallow, silted bedrock in the North Water of Mulroy Bay, Co. Donegal, is characterised by Griffithsia corallinoides (Common) and Codium tomentosum (Frequent) forming a narrow band below the kelp zone (unit MB1-23A2). Cod has not been described from any other sites in Ireland. If Codium spp. is less than Common amongst dense L. saccharina and Chorda filum, it should not be recorded as Cod.         \r\nSituation: This biotope occurs on bedrock below a sublittoral fringe of mixed kelp L. saccharina and Laminaria digitata (unit MB1-23A1) or below a L. saccharina forest (MB1-23A2) or else on isolated boulders on sediment. It appears to be most frequently found in lagoons. Further information on which species of Codium is present and on the associated fauna is required."

The coralline crusts are typically Lithothamnion glaciale, while the brown crusts can be Pseudolithoderma extensum. Encrusting polychaetes Pomatoceros triqueter, resistant to the grazing, are also present on most of the rock. The grazing fauna are a significant component of this biotope; large numbers of P. miliaris are typically present, although where absent the brittlestar Ophiothrix fragilis may occur. Other grazers prevalent on the rock include the chiton Tonicella marmorea, the limpet Tectura testudinalis and the gastropod Gibbula cineraria. A combination of grazing pressure and lowered salinity maintains a low diversity of species in this biotope, with foliose and filamentous seaweeds generally absent or reduced to small tufts by grazing. In stark contrast to the range of seaweeds present in the L. saccharina forests (MB1-23A2) the only red seaweed consistently found in this biotope is Phycodrys rubens. The range of fauna is similarly low, with a conspicuous absence of hydroids and bryozoans. Bedrock and boulders provide a firm substrate on which ascidians Ciona intestinalis and Ascidia mentula and the bivalve Modiolus modiolus can attach. The crabs Pagurus bernhardus and Carcinus maenas can usually be found here, though Necora puber typically is absent due to the brackish conditions. The starfish Asterias rubens along with the whelk Buccinum undatum can be present. The substratum on which this biotope occurs varies from bedrock to boulders or cobbles on sediment. The kelp band is relatively narrow and shallow (upper 5 m) compared to unit MB1-2391, although the grazed coralline encrusted rock extends deeper. This depth limit becomes shallower towards the heads of the sealochs. Geographical distribution This biotope is restricted to the west coast of Scotland, usually near the head of fjordic sealochs, which are influenced by freshwater run-off.                 \r\nSituation: Where circalittoral rock occurs below this biotope, it often supports a brachiopod/anthozoan community (unit MC1-234); where mixed substrata occurs below or adjacent, beds of Modiolus modiolus are common (units MC2-223 or MC4-212).                          \r\nTemporal variation: If the grazing pressure is reduced (i.e. a decrease in the number of grazing echinoderms present) there may be an increase in filamentous and foliose seaweeds although the diversity will remain low compared to full saline sites."

These features usually consist of vertical bedrock walls, occasionally with overhanging faces, and support communities which reflect the degree of wave surge they are subject to, and any scour from mobile substrata on the cave/gully floors. The larger cave and gully systems, such as found in Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles and St Kilda, typically show a marked zonation from the entrance to the rear of the gully/cave as wave surge increases and light reduces. This is reflected in communities of anthozoans, ascidians, bryozoans and red seaweeds near the entrance, leading to sponge crust-dominated communities and finally barnacle and spirorbid worm communities in the most severe surge conditions. Gully/cave floors usually have mobile boulders, cobbles, pebbles or coarse sediment. The mobile nature of the gully/cave floors leads to communities of encrusting species, tolerant of scour and abrasion or fast summer-growing ephemeral species. The lower zone of the gully side walls are also often scoured, and typically colonised by coralline crusts and barnacles.          \r\nSituation: On open rocky coasts with moderate or greater wave action.            \r\nTemporal variation: Unknown, although winter storms likly to yield scouring on gully/cave walls; some ephemeral growth likely in calmer summer months."

The rock may be abraded by the movement of the boulders and cobbles in heavy surge and tends to be dominated by dense foliose seaweeds that grow rapidly in the calmer summer months. Beneath the foliose seaweeds the rock surface is typically covered with coralline crusts, which are longer-lived, and tolerant of abrasion. The flora of this biotope is relatively varied, depending upon the amount of light and degree of abrasion or rock mobility with red seaweeds such as Cryptopleura ramosa, Plocamium cartilagineum, Odonthalia dentata, Callophyllis laciniata, Phycodrys rubens, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Phyllophora crispa and Corallina officinalis. The brown seaweed Dictyota dichotoma also occurs in these conditions, since it is tolerant of some sand scour. During the summer months small fast-growing kelp plants can arise in this biotope, although the mobility of the substratum prevents the kelp from forming a kelp forest. Dense swathes of very young kelp such as Laminaria hyperborea are, however, not uncommon. The faunal community consist of the anemone Urticina felina, the sponge Halichondria panicea and the ascidian Dendrodoa grossularia. More mobile fauna include the echinoderms Asterias rubens and Echinus esculentus, the top shell Gibbula cineraria and the crab Cancer pagurus.                   \r\nSituation: Further into the cave or gully, beyond the dense red seaweeds of MB1-271, the vertical rock grades to either an ascidian and sponge dominated community or sponge crusts and anthozoans (MB1-272 / MB1-273).

Other ascidians, especially Polyclinum aurantium, Diplosoma spp. and other didemnids may also occur, though only P. aurantium is ever as abundant as D. grossularia. Being characteristically found in the middle or towards the backs of the caves mean that there is generally insufficient light to support any foliose seaweeds, although encrusting coralline algae are not uncommon.

Mobile fauna are often limited to the starfish Asterias rubens and Henricia spp., the brittlestar Ophiopholis aculeata and crabs Cancer pagurus and Necora puber. The barnacle Balanus crenatus can occur, usually in low densities.                 \r\nSituation: Where this biotope develops in a cave or tunnel it can occur anywhere from the entrance to the rear of the system. Typically, it will give way to sponge crust or barnacle and encrusting tubeworm communities at the rear of the cave, where surge forces are amplified (units MB1-275 or MB1-2761). The vertical rock below this unit, abutting the cave/gully floor, is likely to be severely scoured, colonised by the robust MB1-2761 biotope. The cave or gully floor is generally scoured clean by boulders and/or cobbles (MB1-2762). The cave or gully entrance has more available light for algal growth so dense foliose seaweeds usually dominate the rock walls at the entrance, abutting the D. grossularia - C. coriacea zone further into the cave (MB1-271). This dense seaweed growth may also extend to the upward-facing surfaces of boulders around the entrance. Where this unit occurs in a gully situation, the rock tends to be colonised by dense Alaria esculenta in the sublittoral fringe (MB1-211) or by Laminaria hyperborea forest in the shallow infralittoral (MB1-2151)."

Small turfs of robust hydroids, such as Diphasia rosacea and Ventromma halecioides, and patches of the barnacle Balanus crenatus, coralline crusts and tube-building spirorbid polychaetes may be present. The starfish Henricia spp., the brittlestar Ophiopholis aculeata and the crabs Cancer pagurus and Necora puber can be present. The anemones Sagartia elegans, Urticina felina and Actinia equina can be found in cracks and crevices or under boulders. The mussel Mytilus edulis may be present in low densities.              \r\nSituation: This surge-tolerant biotope of low-growing fauna is typically confined to the mid or rear section of caves (or the narrowest part of gullies) where the wave-surge is intensified. It generally abuts the less surged ascidian-sponge communities (units MB1-272, MB1-274 and MB1-273). A highly scoured zone of barnacles and calcareous tubeworms often form a zone below, abutting the cave/gully floor (MB1-2761)."

In areas where sufficient light is available and scour is severe, encrusting coralline algae and non-calcareous crusts cover the rock surface, giving a pink appearance. This biotope most commonly occurs at the bottom of walls in caves and gullies, where abrasion by cobbles and stones is severe, especially during winter. In some gullies, extreme scouring and abrasion produces a narrow band of bare coralline algal crust at the very bottom of the walls, with a band of P. triqueter and/or B. crenatus immediately above. Other scour-tolerant species, such as encrusting bryozoans may also be common. Crevices and cracks in the rock provide a refuge for sponge crusts such as Halichondria panicea and occasional anemones Urticina felina and Sagartia elegans. More mobile fauna is usually restricted to the echinoderms Asterias rubens and Echinus esculentus as well as the crab Cancer pagurus. Two variants have been identified: Wave-surged bedrock with coralline crust, B. crenatus and P. triqueter (MB1-2761) and coralline crusts on mobile boulders in severely scoured caves (MB1-2762).                \r\nSituation: Generally occurring at the base of walls in caves and gullies and on the floors of caves and gullies. Immediately above this zone a variety of biotopes may occur depending on the proximity to the cave/gully entrance.

At some sites with extreme wave surge, MB1-2761 can form a zone towards the rear of the cave, beyond the sponge crust zone."

The three varieties of this Cystoseira are good indicators of the upper limit of the infralittoral stage."

In the north-western Mediterranean, these formations are covered with the Neogoniolithon brassica-florida and Lithophyllum byssoides calcareous algae.\r\n- The atoll form: observed in the eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Crete), and in the Bermudas. These are rounded structures, depressed in the centre.\r\n- The ‘pavement’ or ‘platform’ form: the standard structure described in Sicily is a horizontal corroded surface developed in the standing calcareous rock. The platform is pitted with shallow pools whose crests, as well as the outside edges (in the shape of pads or ledges) of the platform, are covered with Dendropoma cristatum Vermetids, often called Vermetus cristatus. In addition, the bottoms of the bowls of the platform can be colonised by Vermetus triquetrus, also known as Vermetus gregarius.\r\nAlthough in the western Mediterranean the position of the platform is below the middle level of the sea and is located at the upper limit of the infralittoral stage, it is always mediolittoral in the eastern Mediterranean, where the platform develops at 0,2-0,3 meters above mid-wave level."

The echinoderms  Ophiothrix fragilis  and  Psammechinus miliaris  and the queen scallop ( Aequipecten opercularis ) are also found throughout this biotope. In shallow water dense  Phycodrys rubens  may grow on the 'reefs'. This biotope has been recorded in the U.K. from Loch Creran, where these reefs have been well studied (Moore 1996), and Loch Sween, where they are reported to have deteriorated. The only other known sites for this biotope are Salt Lake, Cliffden and Killary Harbour, Co. Galway."

This lagoon is usually occupied by small magnoliophytes (Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera noltei) developing on dead matte.\r\nAt the level of the barrier reef, which can be up to several meters wide, the leaves emerge and spread out on the surface of the water, particularly in spring and summer. The reef extends in a gentle slope out to sea, where it constitutes a meadow with a continuous base.\r\nThe classic form of these reefs, with their front parallel to the shore, is the most widespread; however, more extensive particular structures (reef platforms) have been observed in Sicily and Corsica and many typologies have been suggested."

The species is particularly tolerant of variations in salinity, adapting to both oligohaline (low salinity) and hyperhaline (high salinity) waters. It can withstand high rates of eutrophication, and is  sensitive to wave action and intense hydrodynamics. Ficopomatus reefs develop exclusively in brackish environments, where they form belts, barriers and reefs up to one metre thick and from a few dozen centimeters to several meters wide.\r\nThey may also be built in the middle of shallow brackish basins, and look like large mushrooms adhering to fragments of hard substrates (shells, branches, rocks, reeds, etc.), sometimes reaching the surface of the water.

Sabellaria reefs are generally found along exposed sandy coasts, although their concretion does need a rocky base to start with (it may even be an artificial substrate, such as rubble or dockside structures, or small stones)."

      "habitat_description": "Shallow mixed substrata of cobbles and pebbles swept by moderately strong tidal streams in exposed areas, and characterised by dense stands of red seaweeds. Tide-swept infralittoral cobbles and pebbles which may be highly mobile, create an environment that is difficult for many algae to survive in. Foliose and filamentous seaweeds with an encrusting phase in their life history, or those that are able to withstand rolling of the substratum and scouring, can form dense turfs of seaweed in the more settled summer months. Characteristic red seaweeds include Halarachnion ligulatum which is able to survive attached to the pebbles and cobbles. Ephemeral algae grow rapidly in periods of relative stability. Other characteristic red seaweeds include Plocamium cartilagineum, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Brongniartella byssoides. Coralline encrusting algae cover many of the cobbles and pebbles; some areas of cobbles may be quite barren, dominated only by encrusting coralline algae and brittlestars. Of the brown seaweeds scattered Laminaria spp. and Desmarestia spp. may be present on more stable large boulders or bedrock outcrops. Chorda filum and Halidrys siliquosa may be present in low abundance but where these seaweeds occur in greater abundance (typically >Frequent) refer to MB1-233 and MB1-236 respectively. Although the faunal component of this biotope is usually relatively sparse it can include a wide variety of species. Turfs of hydroids (Nemertesia spp., Aglaophenia tubulifera) and bryozoans (Crisia spp. and Bugula spp.) are the major components but sponges and anemones may also occur. Brittlestars, sea-urchins, hydroids and solitary ascidians are more prominent in the Scottish examples of this biotope, which tend to occur in deeper water, due in part to clearer waters.                 \r\nSituation: Although not common, this biotope is widely distributed from Sussex to the shallow areas of the Sarns in Cardigan Bay, the west coast of Scotland and the north-east coast of Ireland. Despite the wide distribution, the red seaweed composition remains remarkably constant. In areas such as the Sarns, in Wales, where mixed substrata continue into the shallows, dense swathes of MB1-233 can be found. More stable but highly scoured areas adjacent to MB1-274 can support the Halidrys biotope MB1-236. Where bedrock or large boulders occur above the mixed substrata of MB1-274 it may support a kelp forest or park (MB1-213 or MB1-21A). At many sites the mixed substrata supporting the dense seaweed turf gives way to sediment of varying composition.              \r\nTemporal variation: This biotope will take on a much more depauperate appearance during the winter months, once the ephemeral seaweeds have died back in late summer/autumn. Storms can mobilise the loose pebbles and cobbles, removing all but the most resilient of seaweeds and animals. By summer, under more stable conditions, new growth will flourish and dense stands of seaweeds dominate the seabed."

It seems likely that stable wave-sheltered maerl beds with low currents may be separable from MB3-221; having a generally thinner layer of maerl overlying a sandy /muddy substratum with a diverse cover of epiphytes (e.g. Bosence 1976; Blunden et al. 1977; 1981; Davies & Hall-Spencer 1996) but insufficient data currently exists on a national scale. Wave and current-exposed maerl beds, where thicker depths of maerl accumulate, frequently occur as waves and ridge / furrows arrangements (see Bosence 1976; Blunden et al. 1977; 1981; Irvine & Chamberlain 1994; Hall-Spencer 1995). At some sites where MB3-221 occurs, there may be significant patches of maerl gravel containing the rare burrowing anemone Halcampoides elongatus ; this may be a separate biotope, but insufficient data exists at present.

Epifaunal communities may be reduced in this biotope when compared to MB5-236; both types may have surface sand waves which may be indicative of the presence of venerid bivalves (Warwick & Davies 1977). This hypothesis, however, requires testing. Remote grab sampling is likely to under-estimate venerid bivalves and other deep-burrowing and more dispersed species such as Paphia, Ensis and Spatangus.

These habitats support interstitial communities living in the spaces between the grains of sand, in particular hesionurid polychaetes such as Hesionura elongata and Microphthalmus similis, along with protodrilid polychaetes such as Protodrilus spp. and Protodriloides spp. Other important species may include Turbellaria spp. and larger deposit feeding polychaetes such as Travisia forbesii. An important feature of this biotope which is not reflected in much of the available data is the importance of the meiofaunal population which may exceed the macrofaunal population both in terms of abundance and biomass (Willems et al. 1982).           \r\nSituation: This biotope is commonly found both in shore adjacent to the coast, and further away from the coast."

This community may be subject to periodical sedimentary disturbance, such that a sub-climactic community may develop with opportunistic taxa such as C. setosa and S. armiger often dominating the community (Allen 2000).              \r\nSituation: This biotope may be found in areas with moderate currents and wave action often facing into the prevailing wind and along the Holderness coast of the North Sea. It is possible that this biotope has developed due to chronic sedimentary disturbance in areas where the units MC5-214 or MB5-236 would normally develop as these biotopes are often found in more sheltered areas adjacent to A5.136.             \r\nTemporal variation: The importance of the cumacean crustaceans in this biotope is unusual, and their numbers are likely to fluctuate over time; at times of increased disturbance it is likely that C. setosa will become more dominant."

      "habitat_description": "Dense beds of Lanice conchilega occur in coarse to medium fine gravelly sand in the shallow sublittoral, where there are strong tidal streams or wave action. Several other species of polychaete also occur as infauna e.g. Spiophanes bombyx, Scoloplos armiger, Chaetozone setosa and Magelona mirabilis. Lanice beds are found in a wide range of habitats including muddier mixed sediment. The dense Lanice biotope (MB3-237) on certain lower shores may be a littoral extension of the current biotope. The presence of L. conchilega in high numbersmay, over time, stabilise the sediment to the extent where a more diverse community may develop (Wood, 1987). Possibly as a result of this, there is a high level of variation with regard the infauna found in MB3-237. It is likely that a number of sub-biotopes may subsequently be identified for this biotope. Offshore from the Wash and the North Norfolk coast Lanice beds are often found intermixed with Sabellaria spinulosa beds in muddier mixed sediment, particularly in the channels between the shallow sandbanks, which are so prevalent in this area (IECS, 1995; NRA, 1995). It is possible that the presence of Lanice has stabilised the habitat sufficiently to allow the deposition of finer material, which has subsequently assisted the development of S. spinulosa. It may be more accurate to define MB3-237 as an epibiotic biotope which overlays a variety of infaunal biotopes (e.g. MB5-233 in finer sands and MC5-214 or MB5-236 in slightly muddier areas)."

This habitat, strictly subject to bottom currents, can change if the movement of the water is artificially or naturally modified, for example during long periods of calm weather. Its extension downwards, into the circalittoral stage, is linked to particularly intense hydrodynamic phenomena, either directly below rocky shelf-edge banks (the Banc des Blauquières) or in straits (the Bouches de Bonifacio). It may, in these conditions, present qualititative and quantitative modifications in its habitual population.

The BGS trigon can be used to define truly mixed or heterogeneous sites with surficial sediments which are a mixture of mud, gravel and sand. However, another 'form' of mixed sediment includes mosaic habitats such as superficial waves or ribbons of sand on a gravel bed or areas of lag deposits with cobbles/pebbles embedded in sand or mud and these are less well defined and may overlap into other habitat or biological subtypes.

The seaweeds Laminaria saccharina and Chorda filum may also be present in some habitats. MB4-211 has a south-western distribution in Britain and Ireland. Sheltered, stable, fully saline maerl beds in the north of Great Britain (where L. corallioides has not been confirmed to occur) may need to be described as an analogous biotope to MB4-211 (see MB3-221)."

This has resulted in many species being described as characteristic of this habitat type all contributing only a small percentage to the overall similarity (see below). This habitat type may also include a newly proposed Chaetopterus biotope (Rees pers com.) recently found in the eastern English Channel. This biotope is characterised by an undescribed Chaetopterus sp. and small Lanice conchilega. Further sampling is need in order to assess and fully characterise this potential biotope. As a result, the Chaetopterus biotope has not been included in this revision.

In MB5-223 the community composition may be dominated by these Zostera species and therefore characterised by the associated biota. Other biota present can be closely related to that of areas of sediment not containing Zostera marina, for example, Laminaria saccharina, Chorda filum and infaunal species such as Ensis spp. and Echinocardium cordatum (e.g. Bamber 1993). From the available data it would appear that a number of sub-biotopes may be found within this biotope dependant on the nature of the substratum and it should be noted that sparse beds of Zostera marina may be more readily characterised by their infaunal community. For example, coarse marine sands with seagrass have associated communities similar to MB3-233, MB3-237 or MB3-235 whilst muddy sands may have infaunal populations related to MB5-235, MB5-237 and MB5-236. Muddy examples of this biotope may show similarities to MB6-242, MB6-249, MB6-248 or MB6-248. At present the data does not permit a detailed description of these sub-biotopes but it is likely that with further study the relationships between these assemblages will be clarified. Furthermore, whilst the Zostera biotope may be considered an epibiotic overlay of established sedimentary communities it is likely that the presence of Zostera will modify the underlying community to some extent. For example, beds of this biotope in the south-west of Britain may contain conspicuous and distinctive assemblages of Lusitanian fauna such as Laomedea angulata, Hippocampus spp. and Stauromedusae. In addition, it is known that seagrass beds play an important role in the trophic status of marine and estuarine waters, acting as an important conduit or sink for nutrients and consequently some examples of Zostera marina beds have markedly anoxic sediments associated with them."

Other notable taxa within this biotope include occasional Lanice conchilega, Pagurus and Liocarcinus spp. and Asterias rubens. This biotope has primarily been recorded by epifaunal dive, video or trawl surveys where the presence of relatively conspicuous taxa such as E. cordatum and Ensis spp. have been recorded as characteristic of the community. However, these species, particularly E. cordatum have a wide distribution and are not necessarily the best choice for a characteristic taxa (Thorson, 1957). Furthermore, detailed quantitative infaunal data for this biotope is often rather scarce, possibly as a result of survey method as remote grab sampling is likely to under-estimate deep-burrowing species such as Ensis sp. (Warwick & Davis 1977). Consequently, it may be better to treat this biotope as an epibiotic overlay which is likely to overlap a number of other biotopes such as units MB5-236, MB5-233 and MC5-214 with infaunal components of these biotopes occurring within MB5-235. The precise nature of this infaunal community will be related to the nature of the substratum, in particular the quantity of silt/clay present. Infaunal species may include the polychaetes Spiophanes bombyx, Magelona mirabilis, Nephtys cirrosa and Chaetozone setosa and the amphipod Bathyporeia spp. This biotope is currently broadly defined and needs further consideration as to whether it should be placed at biotope or biotope complex level. MB5-237 is another biotope based primarily on epibiotic data. It is likely that this biotope and MB5-235 form a wider epibiotic sand /muddy sand community with MB5-235 biased towards sandier areas and MB5-237 towards slightly muddier areas."

This biotope may be characterised by a prevalence of Fabulina fabula and Magelona mirabilis or other species of Magelona (e.g. M. filiformis). Other taxa, including the amphipod Bathyporeia spp. and polychaetes such as Chaetozone setosa, Spiophanes bombyx and Nephtys spp. are also commonly recorded. In some areas the bivalve Spisula elliptica may also occur in this biotope in low numbers. The community is relatively stable in its species composition, however, numbers of Magelona and F. Fabulina tend to fluctuate. Around the Scilly Isles numbers of F. fabulina in this biotope are uncommonly low whilst these taxa are often found in higher abundances in muddier communities (presumably due to the higher organic content). Consequently it may be better to revise this biotope on the basis of less ubiquitous taxa such as key amphipod species (E.I.S. Rees pers. comm. 2002) although more data is required to test this. MB5-236 and MB3-233 are collectively considered to be the 'shallow Venus community' or 'boreal off-shore sand association' of previous workers (see Petersen 1918; Jones 1950; Thorson 1957). These communities have been shown to correlate well with particular levels of current induced 'bed-stress' (Warwick & Uncles 1980). The 'Arctic Venus Community' and 'Mediterranean Venus Community' described to the north and south of the UK (Thorson 1957) probably occur in the same habitat and appears to be the same biotope described as the Ophelia borealis community in northern France and the central North Sea (Künitzer et al. 1992). Sites with this biotope may undergo transitions in community composition. The epibiotic biotopes MB5-235 and MB5-237 may also overlay this biotope in some areas."

The sediments in which this community is found may vary with regard silt content but they generally have less than 20% silt/clay and in some areas may contain a degree of shell debris. This biotope falls somewhere between MB5-236 and MC5-214 with regard sediment type (i.e. somewhat muddier than MB5-236 and less muddy than MC5-214) and may have species in common with both. As a result, other important species in this community include Abra alba, Fabulina fabula spp. and Mysella bidentata spp. In addition, Diastylis rathkei/typical, Philine aperta (in muddier sediments), Ampelisca spp., Ophiura albida, Phaxas pellucidus and occasionally Bathyporeia spp, may also be important, although this is not clear from the data available. In areas of slightly coarser, less muddy sediment S. solida or S. elliptica may appear occasionally in this biotope. Abundances of Spisula subtruncata in this biotope are often very high and distinguish it from other closely related biotopes. Extensive areas of this community to the north east of the Dogger Bank were recorded in the 1950s, but these seem to have declined since then (Kroncke 1990).

For example MB5-238 has been recorded in Red Wharf Bay and Conwy Bay where it appears to be short term variant of other more established biotopes (e.g. MC5-214) and appears to have only intermittent occurrence in single age cohort patches possibly due to predation in some areas (e.g. Red Wharf Bay) by the common Scoter Melanitta nigra (E.I.S.

The biocenosis begins at around 2-2.5 meters and may reach a depth of 25 meters; sometimes it occupies vast areas along the coasts or in wide bays.\r\nLocally, the biocenosis of well sorted fine sands tolerates a slight lack of saltiness in the water near estuaries and surrounding some Mediterranean ponds. It thus presents a certain impoverishment, offset by the presence of some euryhaline species. When the wave action is too strong, the biocenosis can also be impoverished. Locally, the Cymodocea nodosa phanerogam can colonise certain areas, where it will constitute a local facies with epiflora. The fairly localized presence of some species (Caulerpa prolifera, Halophila stipulacea…) also determines the forming of local facies.

      "habitat_description": "Sublittoral stable cohesive sandy muds occurring over a wide depth range may support large populations of semi-permanent tube-building amphipods and polychaetes. In particular large numbers of the amphipods Ampelisca spp. and Photis longicaudata may be present along with polychaetes such as Lagis koreni. Other important taxa may include bivalves such as Nucula nitidosa, Chamelea gallina, Abra alba and Mysella bidentata and the echinoderms Echinocardium cordatum and Amphiura brachiata. In some areas polychaetes such as Spiophanes bombyx and Polydora ciliata may also be conspicuously numerous. This community is poorly known, appearing to occur in restricted patches. In some areas it is possible that MB6-245 may develop as a result of moderate organic enrichment. A similar community in mud has also been reported in the Baltic which is characterised by large populations of amphipods such as Ampelisca spp., Corophium spp. and Haploopstubicola (see Petersen 1918; Thorson 1957) and it is not known if MB6-245 is a UK variant of this biotope.           \r\nTemporal variation: In some areas of the Irish Sea this biotope is reported to be a temporal variant of units MB5-238, MC5-214 and MC6-215. Some researchers consider these biotopes to be part of a wider muddy sand community which varies temporally depending on changes in sediment deposition and recruitment as was reported in areas of Red Wharf Bay off the Welsh coast (E.I.S. Rees pers. comm. 2002)"

In very polluted/disturbed areas only Capitella, Nematodes and occasional Malacoceros fuliginosus may be found whilst in slightly less enriched areas and estuaries species such as Tubificoides, Cirriformia tentaculata, Pygospio elegans and Polydora ciliata may also be found. In some areas e.g. the Tees estuary, high numbers of the polychaete Ophryotrocha may also be present. MB6-246 may become established as a result of anthropogenic activities such as fish farming and sewerage effluent but may also occur with natural enrichment as a result of, for example, coastal bird roosts. This biotope may also occur to some extent in the intertidal and in estuaries.          \r\nSituation: This biotope typically occurs in marine inlets, embayments or estuaries where organic enrichment allows C. capitata to out compete other taxa, although the species may also occur in enriched muddy coastal sediments and also offshore where there is a high organic input from adjacent oil drilling platforms (units MD6-216 & MD6-2161)."

      "habitat_description": "Physically very stable muds, occasionally with small stones, with a high proportion of fine material (typically greater than 80 %) may contain the opisthobranch Philine aperta and the seapen Virgularia mirabilis. These muds typically occur in shallow water down to about 12-15 m where significant seasonal variation in temperature is presumed to occur. This habitat is restricted to the most sheltered basins in, for example, sealochs. Although most records suggest full salinity conditions are prevalent, some sites may be subject to variable salinity. Philine aperta is the most characteristic species of this habitat, occurring in high densities at many sites, whilst Virgularia mirabilis, a species found more widely in muddy sediments, appears to reach its highest densities in this shallow mud but may not be present in all examples of this biotope. Other conspicuous species found in this shallow muddy habitat include Cerianthus lloydii, Pagurus bernhardus, Sagartiogeton spp. and Hydractinia echinata. Burrowing crustacean megafauna, characteristic of deeper mud, are rare or absent from this shallow sediment although Nephrops norvegicus may sometimes be recorded. This biotope has been primarily recorded on the basis of its epifauna and a few conspicuous infauna. Little data exists on the infaunal component of this biotope but it may include Nephtys spp., spionid polychaetes, Ampelisca spp. and the bivalves Nucula spp., Thyasiraflexuosa, Mysellabidentata and Abra spp. In the south of Great Britain, the polychaete Sternaspisscutata is also characteristic of this biotope. This polychaete is rare in Great Britain (Sanderson 1996). Indeed, this southern variant of the biotope is very restricted in the UK to Portland Harbour but is known to occur further south in the Gulf of Gascony and the Mediterranean (Glemarec 1973; Dauvin et al. 1994).       \r\nTemporal variation: It is possible that this biotope is a temporal variant of other subunits of A5.3. The key species, Philine aperta, may be highly variable from year to year The sediment may also be covered by a diatom film at certain times of the year"

The fauna is normally impoverished at such sites, with few elements of the infaunal communities present in other muddy biotopes. Scavenging species such as Asteriasrubens and Carcinus maenas are typically present where the habitat is not too anoxic along with occasional Arenicolamarina but in extreme conditions of anoxia little survives other than the Beggiatoa.

P. ciliata also occurs in high densities elsewhere (see unit A4.232) and may be a specific feature of the Humber Estuary in these conditions. This biotope occurs only in very firm mud and clay and possibly submerged relict saltmarsh with a high detrital content. It is characterised, and can be separated from other biotopes, by a combination of the sediment characteristics and the very high density of Polydora ciliata. In some areas, such as the Humber estuary, cyclical behaviour with regard its characteristic taxa has been reported with either P. ciliata or C. volutator increasing in dominance at the expense of the other (Gameson 1982). It is possible that changes in water quality or the sediment regime may be responsible for this."

Where Capitella is less abundant and accompanied by other typical estuarine species the dominance of Capitella may be associated with other natural factors including the occurrence of a competitive refuge for C. capitata in the reduced-salinity environment (Wolff 1973)."

There may be scattered clumps of hydroids such as Sertularia argentea and Nemertesia antennina. Where `relative shelter' is afforded by the topography of the seabed, the bryozoans Flustra foliacea, Alcyonidium diaphanum and the crab Cancer pagurus may be found. More ubiqutous species such as Asterias rubens and Calliostoma zizyphinum may also be present."

It is commonly associated with areas where turbidity levels are high for much of the year, for example, around Anglesey and the Lleyn Penisula. From afar, this variant appears as a dense carpet of Tubularia indivisa covering tide-swept gully walls, floors and boulders. T. indivisa is frequently observed growing through sheets of sponges such as Myxilla incrustans and Halichondria panicea as well as through dense patches of the barnacle Balanus crenatus and tubes of the amphipod Jassa spp. Several other species of sponge appear to be tolerant of the high turbidity in areas where this variant occurs, many of which are common in other biotopes. These include Esperiopsis fucorum, Pachymatisma johnstonia, Hemimycale columella, Dysidea fragilis and Clathrina coriacea. Robust hydroids (other than T. indivisa) such as Nemertesia antennina and Sertularia argentea occur in patches. The anemones Urticina felina, Actinothoe sphyrodeta and Sagartia elegans are typically common. A short bryozoan turf consisting of crisiid bryozoans, Alcyonidium diaphanum, Bicellariella ciliata, Bugula turbinata and Bugula flabellata may be present. Alcyonium digitatum may occasionally be seen although it doesn't tend to be as dominant as in MC1-2122. Individual Corynactis viridis may be seen scattered across the gully walls and boulders. The starfish Henricia oculata may be seen on boulders and gully floors whilst typical under-boulder fauna includes the crab Cancer pagurus.      \r\nSituation: Above this biotope, Laminaria forest (unit MB1-213) may be found."

The biotope is exposed to varying amounts of scour (due to nearby patches of sediment) and, as a consequence, is characteristically dominated by dense Flustra folicaea, a range of colonial ascidians and a variety of other scour/silt-tolerant species. In addition to F. foliacea, other bryozoans present in this biotope include Alcyonidium diaphanum, Bugula flabellata and Bugula plumosa. Varying amounts of the soft coral Alcyonium digitatum may be recorded, depending on the amount of scouring which may vary locally. Where scour is a major factor, species such as the scour-tolerant Urticina felina are frequently observed.

There may be scattered clumps of the hydroids Abietinaria abietina and Hydrallmania falcata. Other species present include the anemones Metridium senile, Sagartia elegans and Urticina felina, the starfish Asterias rubens, the crab Necora puber, the nudibranch Janolus cristatus and the soft coral Alcyonium digitatum. This biotope has currently only been recorded off the east coast of Anglesey, Wales."

      "habitat_description": "This biotope is typically found on exposed slopes of silty cobble and pebble subject to strong to moderate tidal streams. From afar, large 'finger' growths of the sponge Haliclona oculata occur amongst a rich faunal turf of hydroids and bryozoans with Flustra foliacea prominent. The dense faunal turf growing on the cobbles is composed of the bryozoans F. foliacea, Alcyonidium diaphanum and Crisia eburnea and sporadic occurrences of the hydroids Nemertesia antennina, Hydrallmania falcata,Tubularia larynx, Rhizocaulus verticillatus and Halecium halecinum. Caprellid shrimps may be observed within this faunal turf. The hard substratum frequently has a dense covering of the sponge H. oculata and occasionally Esperiopsis fucorum, while the softer gravely/sand between the cobbles provides a habitat for anemones such as Urticina felina and Cerianthus lloydii. The nudibranch Janolus cristatus may be seen preying on the faunal turf and the fan worm Sabella pavonia is occasionally seen amongst the cobbles. The soft coral Alcyonium digitatum is often attached to the upper faces of more stable cobbles and rocks, while in the crevices between cobbles, the anemone Sagartia elegans, the crab Cancer pagurus, the prawn Pandalus montagui and the amphipod Dyopedos porrectus may be observed. Under-cobble fauna includes terebellid worms and Harmothoe spp. This biotope has been recorded from the Menai Strait, Milford Haven and Morecambe Bay."

      "habitat_description": "This biotope is typically found on slightly sand-scoured, tide-swept, moderately exposed circalittoral bedrock and cobbles. It is commonly recorded from the shallower reaches of the circalittoral around depths from 5m to 15m BCD, as it occurs mostly in very turbid waters. From afar, the physical characteristics are usually silted bedrock reefs and cobble, interspersed with patches of clean sand, causing a scour effect on the rock. Dense aggregations of the ascidian Molgula manhattensis form a silty mat on the rock and there is a sparse hydroid and bryozoan turf. A hydroid turf, composed of Nemertesia antennina, Halecium beanii, Hydrallmania falcata, Sertularella gaudichaudi, Tubularia indivisa and Alcyonium digitatum, in varying amounts, occurs at most sites on the tops of boulders and ridges. A bryozoan turf is also present, but not usually dense and includes Flustra foliacea, Alcyonidium diaphanum, Electra pilosa and the crust-forming bryozoan Conopeum reticulum. The polychaete Lanice conchilega thrives in the sandy patches which often occur between the rock ridges. The scour effect tends to reduce the diversity of sponges present with only Halichondria panicea occasionally present. Isolated clumps of the polychaete Sabellaria spinulosa may be present but they do not occur in dense aggregations as in the MC2-2131 biotope. The anemones Urticina felina and Sagartia troglodytes may occur in cracks between cobbles or on stones buried in the sandy substratum. The anemone Sagartia elegans is more commonly found attached to crevices in the bedrock. Other species such as the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus, the barnacle Balanus crenatus, the polychaete Sabella pavonia and Pomatoceros triqueter may all be present whilst the crab Pisidia longicornis may be found under cobbles and stones. Records of this biotope are distributed along the south coast of England and the north Wales coast as well as Pembrokeshire near the entrance to Milford Haven.         \r\nSituation: As this biotope is often recorded on soft rock (chalk), soft rock communities (MC1-25 biotope complex) would be observed in close proximity with species of the genus Polydora and piddocks (Pholas spp. and Barnea spp). Moderately exposed kelp forests may be found within the shallow infralittoral zone."

The fauna is often sparse with the frequently observed Echinus esculentus giving it a grazed appearance, but the community may also be affected by violent storm action working into deep water during winter storms. Despite this spartan appearance, the community is relatively diverse and contains a wide range of sponges, hydroids, bryozoans and echinoderms. This variant is found on open coasts or offshore, and is characterised by the cup-coral Caryophyllia smithii, Alcyonium digitatum, the sea urchin Echinus esculentus, large specimens of the sponge Cliona celata, encrusting bryozoans and encrusting red algae. Although this variant tends to occur in deep water (depth range of 20-30m), a high degree of water clarity allows some red algae to grow at these depths.

Although many of these species are found on subtidal rock, they tend to occur in larger numbers in these highly sand-influenced conditions. The dominant species by far is the anemone Urticina felina which commonly occurs on rocks at the sand-rock interface, where the scour levels are at a maximum and few species can tolerate this abrasion. The sponge Ciocalypta penicillus is also very characteristic of shifting sand-covered rock. This biotope is only occasionally recorded as a separate entity, because its extent is typically restricted to a very narrow band of rock at the sediment interface. Only occasionally does it cover a large extent of rock (e.g. where the wave action is strong enough to cause sand abrasion well up the rock face or where the rock is low-lying). More often, this scoured zone is recorded as part of whatever biotope occurs on the nearby hard substrata. Other species (which are able to survive, and benefit from the reduced competition) include Balanus crenatus, Pomatoceros triqueter, Cellepora pumicosa, Alcyonidium diaphanum, Cliona celata, encrusting red algae and Asterias rubens.          \r\nSituation: This biotope tends to be found in close proximity to mobile sand or gravel, producing scour that tends to limit the number of species found."

The biotope is dominated by faunal (e.g. Parasmittinatrispinosa) and algal (Corallinaceae) crusts, and tends to have a grazed appearance; this may be partially attributable to the abundance of Echinus esculentus found in this biotope. Occasionally, the rock may appear pink from a distance, due to the expanses of encrusting red algae on the rock surface. Alcyonium digitatum is one of the few species to stand erect from the encrusted rock surface and are frequently encountered, on the tops of rocky outcrops and boulders. Hydroids do not form a prominent feature of this biotope, with only robust species such as Abietinaria abietina frequently recorded.

Under closer inspection, the white tubes of the polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter may be observed on the rock and boulders, especially on vertical faces. There may be sandy/gravelly patches in between the boulders colonised by the anemone Urticina felina. The regular occurrence of large numbers of the sea urchin Echinus esculentus in this biotope may be responsible for grazing the faunal and algal turf, thus keeping species richness relatively low.

This biotope is characteristic of the bedrock terraces along the Northumberland coast that are generally species impoverished compared to similar F. foliacea biotopes on the west coasts of the UK, which have a more diverse range of sponges, hydroids and bryozoans. As the turbidity levels increase in this fairly silty biotope, so the species diversity is reduced.       \r\nSituation: This biotope typically occurs around coasts subject to sand scour and siltation. Associated biotopes common around the north-east coast of England include circalittoral gravel and coarse sands. Typical species present include Echinocardium, Lanice conchilega, Ensis spp., Mya truncata and Myxicola. Where suitable substratum is available, exposed kelp forests occur in the infralittoral (the latter normally occupies a narrow band due to the high silt loading in the water column).

There is a tendency for slight scouring to occur in this biotope. However, if this scour increases further, for example if water movement increases, mobilising more sand, this biotope may graduate into MC1-223. In more silty sites, there is a tendency for S. securifrons to be replaced by F. foliacea as the dominant bryozoan, turning the biotope into MC1-2241.               \r\nTemporal variation: Whilst the great majority of species in this variant are most likely present throughout the year, C. lepadiformis grows in spring and may show great variation in abundance from year to year."

      "habitat_description": "This variant is typically found on the upper faces of exposed and moderately exposed circalittoral bedrock or boulders subjected to moderately strong to weak tidal streams. From afar, the seabed has a rather sparse, grazed appearance, reminiscent of a brittlestar bed after the brittlestars have moved elsewhere. The rocky substratum is generally covered with encrusting red algae and the white, calcareous tubes of the polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter, dotted with the abundant urchin Echinus esculentus. Under closer inspection, Alcyonium digitatum are usually seen attached to the rocky surface underneath rock overhangs and large boulders. Although they may be recorded as abundant or common in some areas, their relatively small size means that their biomass is generally lower than in other biotopes. Sparse clumps of robust hydroids such as Abietinaria abietina are frequently observed, and bryozoan crusts such as Parasmittina trispinosa are occasionally seen. Echinoderms such as the brittlestars Ophiothrix fragilis and Ophiocomina nigra, and the crab Cancer pagurus may be seen within crevices in the boulders/rock whilst the starfish Asterias rubens may be seen on the rock surface. Muddy-gravel patches between boulders (especially within Scottish sealochs) provide a suitable habitat for the anemone Urticina felina. The top shell Gibbula cineraria is occasionally seen grazing on the rock surface. Within this biotope, there is some regional variation. The robust hydroid A. abietina is typically found in higher abundances in northern (Scottish) regions, especially around the Isle of May.           \r\nSituation: Above the MC1-2245 variant in the infralittoral zone, species such as Alaria esculenta and Laminaria hyperborea are found in more wave exposed sites (MB1-211 / MB1-213) while species such as Laminaria saccharina may be found above MC1-2245 in the more sheltered examples. Due to moderately tide-swept conditions this variant is found in, clean, coarse sediment biotopes are generally found below MC1-2245. Typical species found in these coarse sand/gravelly biotopes include Neopentadactyla mixta and Lanice conchilega (MC4-2). Where wave exposure increases, this variant tends to change to MC1-2222, dominated by Caryophyllia smithii, Corynactis viridis, encrusting red algae and bryozoan crusts. Where tidal stream and wave-exposure decreases, this variant develops into a similar biotope dominated by encrusting red algae, Echinus esculentus and C.smithii (MC1-2246)."

      "habitat_description": "This variant is typically found on the upper and vertical faces of exposed and moderately wave-exposed circalittoral rock, subject to very little water movement. Where this variant is found on slightly more wave-exposed sites, it tends to be found towards the bottom of its depth range. The rocky substratum has a grazed appearance, with encrusting red algae. Diversity of species is very low, possibly due to grazing pressure from the sea urchin Echinus esculentus. From afar, there is little evident epifauna attached to the rocks apart from the white, calcareous tubes of the polychaete Pomatoceros triqueter and the cup-coral Caryophyllia smithii. In addition, bryozoan crusts such as Parasmittina trispinosa are frequently seen. Under closer inspection, a few more species become apparent but few are typically characterising of this particular variant. The echinoderms Antedon bifida, Asterias rubens, Ophiothrix fragilis, Marthasterias glacialis, Ophiocomina nigra and Crossaster papposus are occasionally present. Sparse clumps of hydroids such as Halecium halecinum, Kirchenpaueria pinnata and Nemertesia antennina may be found attached to rocky outcrops or boulders. Small specimens of Alcyonium digitatum may be present. The ascidians Ciona intestinalis, Clavelina lepadiformis and Ascidia mentula also occur in this variant but are found in greater numbers in other biotopes. The top shells Calliostoma zizyphinum, Gibbula cineraria, and the saddle oyster Pododesmus patelliformis may be seen on the rock surface whilst the crab Cancer pagurus may be seen under boulders and in crevices. The anemone Metridium senile may be found under rocky overhangs and on the sides of boulders.         \r\nSituation: As MC1-2246 occurs on moderately wave-exposed coasts, kelp forests in the infralittoral zone shallower than this variant tend to be dominated by robust kelp species such as Laminaria hyperborea (unit MB1-21A) and Saccorhiza polyschides. Immediately below MC1-2246 (typically bedrock/boulder substratum), sublittoral sediment biotopes such as muddy sands, containing Nephrops norvegicus, Virgularia mirabilis and Funiculina quadrangularis are found. Occasionally, biotopes composed of coarser sand/gravelly material may be present, with species such as Peachea cylindrica and Neopentadactyla mixta. When wave exposure and tidal stream increase, MC1-2246 tends to grade into MC1-2245."

Three regional variations of this biotope have been recorded. One variant found typically off the north-east coast of Scotland and around the Northern Isles, has a very impoverished appearance dominated by anthozoans. A second variant occurs along the west coast of Scotland, extending to Rockall in the west, and the Northern Isles in the north-east, and has a more fauna, characterised by hydroids, sponges, anthozoans and echinoderms. A third variant occurs along the north-east coast of England (Northumberland) up to the Northern Isles and is dominated by Alcyonium digitatum, brittlestars and Echinus esculentus."

A diverse ascidian fauna is generally present, including Ascidia mentula, Aplidium punctum, Corella parallelogramma, Ascidia virginea, Botryllus schlosseri, Clavelina lepadiformis and Ciona intestinalis. An equally diverse sponge fauna, with massive erect sponges particularly noticeable, compliments these species. Dominant species include Esperiopsis fucorum, Dysidea fragilis, Tethya aurantium, Polymastia boletiformis, Raspailia ramosa, Stelligera stuposa, Polymastia mamilliaris and Pachymatisma johnstonia. Other sponges present are Suberites carnosus, Haliclona fistulosa, Stelligera rigida, Mycale rotalis, Haliclona simulans, Iophon hyndmani and Hemimycale columella. Various sponge crusts may also be present but in most cases in lower abundances. Other significant components of the community include the cup coral Caryophyllia smithii and various echinoderms, including the sea urchin Echinus esculentus and the starfish Henricia oculata and Marthasterias glacialis. Small isolated clumps of Nemertesia antennina and individual Alcyonium digitatum may be seen, whilst the top shell Calliostoma zizyphinum may also be present. At present, there are relatively few records in this biotope, as it is only reported from around the south-western coast of Ireland, where sponge diversity is very high.         \r\nSituation: Due to the sheltered nature of the biotope, this unit is usually situated on bedrock/boulder outcrops associated with mud slopes and plains. Typical species found within these circalittoral muds include the seapen Virgularia mirablis and the anemone Pachycerianthus multiplicatus. In the infralittoral zone, sheltered kelp biotopes such as MB3-211 with Laminaria saccharina occur frequently. In areas where there is a slightly stronger tidal-stream, the circalittoral muddy plains become more muddy gravel plains and slopes. Typical species found within these habitats include the anemones Mesacmaea mitchellii and Aureliana heterocera. When tidal-streams becomes negligible, but with similar wave-sheltered conditions, you tend to find MC1-2211 biotopes occurring, especially in the same geographical location (around south-west/west Ireland) as MC1-232."

When the water is very clear, the coralligenous begins and ends very deep (60-130 meters), but when the water is turbid, it rises to shallower depths (10/15-40 meters). Such a rise may also be seen along dimly lit rock faces (north- facing, for example). The thermal scope of seasonal variation for this habitat is variable, and a certain tolerance of fluctuation in salinity has been observed; however, the sedimentation of fine particles is particularly harmful.\r\nThe coralligenous can present various physiognomical types between the two most typical forms on our coasts, which are:\r\n- the rock wall coralligenous which covers the rocky substrata beyond the photophilous algae, with more or less thick concretions and an abundance of big erect invertebrates, such as the Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella spp., Leptogorgia sarmentosa gorgonians and the Axinella polypoides sponge\r\n- the coralligenous concretion forming biogenous clumps that can be several meters thick and cover big horizontal or non-horizontal surfaces. This coralligenous is a fully biogenic habitat. The essential species are the constructive Corallinaceae and Peyssonneliaceae species; the structure of these clumps is highly anfractuous, with many cavities of great richness (parts of the biocenosis of semi-dark caves)."

This habitat constitutes the transition between the beds of hard substrata with concretions, where the calcareous algae and other sciaphilous algae play a basic part, and the caves in total darkness, where the physical environment is extremely selective and the population is exclusively animal. In this habitat, light and water movement diminish rapidly the greater the distance from the entrance to the cave (i.e. the open sea) and according to topographical factors. As a result, there is a tendency to environmental stability, which increases with the distance from the entrance, and a drop in the presence and abundance of certain groups of organisms (like passive filterers). This biocenosis is characterised by a frequent juxtaposition of facies, partly linked to the variability of the habitat caused by the environmental topography, but also certainly resulting from historical recruitment events. The biocenosis of semi-dark caves only contains a few rare sciaphilous algae, restricted to the area that is nearest to the outside environment, and has no herbivores. The trophic network is thus composed of filterers, scavengers and carnivores only. A confinement appears following a gradient that goes from the outside to the inside of the cave, with a drop in external additions, and a development of organisms that are not very demanding or are well adapted to exploiting a weak, unpredictable trophic resource."

The reefs formed by Sabellaria consolidate the sediment and allow the settlement of other species not found in adjacent habitats leading to a diverse community of epifaunal and infauna species. The development of such reefs is assisted by the settlement behaviour of larval Sabellaria which are known to selectively settle in areas of suitable sediment and particularly on existing Sabellaria tubes (Tait and Dipper, 1997; Wilson 1929). These reefs are particularly affected by dredging or trawling and in heavily dredged or disturbed areas an impoverished community may be left (e.g. MC3-213) particularly if the activity or disturbance is prolonged. However, it is likely that reefs of S. spinulosa can recover quite quickly from short term or intermediate levels of disturbance as found by Vorberg (2000) in the case of disturbance from shrimp fisheries and recovery will be accelerated if some of the reef is left intact following disturbance as this will assist larval settlement of the species.             \r\nSituation: S. spinulosa reefs are often found in areas with quite high levels of natural sediment disturbance.              \r\nTemporal variation: In some areas the reefs are periodically destroyed by storm events leading to a cyclical shift in biotopes from MC2-211 to other biotopes e.g. MC3-213 or MC5-214 with re-establishment of the Sabellaria colonies in the following year."

This biotope often grades into MC4-214 which is characterised by large amounts of the above hydroids on stones also covered in Pomatoceros and barnacles.

Other taxa may include Nemertea spp., Protodorvillea kefersteini, Owenia fusiformis, Spiophanes bombyx and Amphipholis squamata along with amphipods such as Ampelisca spinipes. This biotope may also be characterised by the presence of conspicuous venerid bivalves, particularly Timoclea ovata. Other robust bivalve species such as Moerella spp., Glycymerisglycymeris and Astartesulcata may also be found in this biotope. Spatanguspurpureus may be present especially where the interstices of the gravel are filled by finer particles, in which case, Garitellinella may also be prevalent (Glemarec 1973). Venerid bivalves are often under-sampled in benthic grab surveys and as such may not be conspicuous in many infaunal datasets. Such communities in gravelly sediments may be relatively species-rich and they may also contain epifauna such as Hydroides norvegicus and Pomatoceros lamarcki. In sand wave areas this biotope may also contain elements of the MB5-236 biotope, particularly Magelona species. This biotope has previously been described as the 'Deep Venus Community' and the 'Boreal Off-Shore Gravel Association' by other workers (Ford 1923; Jones 1950) and may also be part of the Venus community described by Thorson (1957) and in the infralittoral etage described by Glemarec (1973). MC3-212 may be quite variable over time and in fact may be closer to a biotope complex in which a number of biotopes or sub-biotopes may yet be defined. For example, Ford (1923) describes a 'Series A' and a 'Series B' characterised by Echinocardium cordatum-Chamelea gallina and Spatangus purpurea-Clausinella fasciata. Furthermore, mosaics of cobble and lag gravel often contain ridges of coarse gravelly sand and these localised patches are also characterised by robust veneriid and similar bivalves including Arcopagia crassa, Laevicardium crassum and others including Glycymeris glycymeris (E.I.S. Rees pers. comm. 2002). This high porosity fine gravel or coarse sand may be a separate biotope.       \r\nSituation: This biotope and variants of it make up a significant proportion of the offshore Irish Sea benthos (Mackie, Oliver & Rees 1995).      \r\nTemporal variation: MC3-212 may be quite variable over time."

Sessile epifauna are typically a minor component of this community. This biotope has been described from a limited number of records and as such may need revising when further data become available. This biotope is related to the 'Boreal Offshore Gravel Association' and 'Deep Venus Community' described by other workers (Ford 1923; Jones 1951), and may also be closely allied (the same?) as the ' Venus fasciata ' community of Cabioch (Glemarec 1973).

The interstices between these various components are partially filled by a greater or lesser proportion of sand and mud. The muddy portion is usually less than 20%, but various more or less muddy types exist. Fragmentation of the debris is not due to the always weak hydrodynamics, but to the action of organisms that attack the limestone (Cliona spp., Polydora spp., lithophagous Pelecypoda, etc. However, the regular or intermittent existence of bottom currents has frequently been stressed."

The epibiosis is also that of the standard biocenosis, enriched by calcareous Rhodophyceae such as Peyssonnelia rosa-marina, Neurocaulon spp., and by species of the coralligenous biocenosis and of its facies, particularly the association with Cystoseira zosteroides. Many epibionts (hydrozoans and bryozoans, particularly, and also sponges, polychaetes and ascidians) are present on the oldest part of the fronds, one side being clearly more populated than the other because the thalli are laid down flat on the bed."

      "habitat_description": "Pebbles and cobbles on mud or muddy gravel in sealochs with frequent Cerianthus lloydii and occasional Modiolus modiolus. Large burrowing holothurians may include Psolus phantapus, Paracucumaria hyndmani, Thyonidium commune, Thyone fusus and Leptopentacta elongate. Many of these species only extend their tentacles above the sediment surface seasonally and are likely to be under recorded by epifaunal surveys. Other more conspicuous characterising taxa include Pagurus bernhardus, Asterias rubens, and Buccinum undatum. This biotope is well developed in the Clyde sealochs, although many examples are rather species-poor. Some examples in south-west Scottish sealochs have greater quantities of boulders and cobbles and therefore have a richer associated biota (compared with other sheltered Modiolus bed biotopes such as MC2-223). Examples in Shetland are somewhat different in having the cucumber Cucumaria frondosa amongst sparse Modiolus beds and a slightly different balance in abundance of other species; for example the brittlestar Ophiopholis aculeata is more abundant in these far northern examples in the voes and narrows"

Flustra foliacea and the hydroid Hydrallmania falcata characterise this biotope; lesser amounts of other hydroids such as Sertularia argentea, Nemertesia antennina and occasionally Nemertesia ramose, occur where suitably stable hard substrata is found. The anemone Urticina feline and the soft coral Alcyonium digitatum may also characterise this biotope. Barnacles Balanus crenatus and tube worms Pomatoceros triqueter may be present and the robust bryozoans Alcyonidium diaphanum and Vesicularia spinosa appear amongst the hydroids at a few sites. Sabella pavonina and Lanice conchilega may be occasionally found in the coarse sediment around the stones. In shallower (i.e. upper circalittoral) examples of this biotope scour-tolerant robust red algae such as Polysiphonianigrescens, Calliblepharis spp. and Gracilariagracilis are found.         \r\nSituation: This biotope is found around most coasts, although regional differences are seen where one or two similarly scour-tolerant species such as Styelaclava and Crepidulafornicata (Solent) occupy the hard substrata"

      "habitat_description": "Circalittoral sediment dominated by brittlestars (hundreds or thousands per square metre) forming dense beds, living epifaunally on boulder, gravel or sedimentary substrata. Ophiothrix fragilis and Ophiocomina nigra are the main bed-forming species, with rare examples formed by Ophiopholis aculeate. Brittlestar beds vary in size, with the largest extending over hundreds of square metres of sea floor and containing millions of individuals. They usually have a patchy internal structure, with localized concentrations of higher animal density. Ophiothrix fragilis or Ophiocomina nigra may dominate separately or there may be mixed populations of the two species. Ophiothrix beds may consist of large adults and tiny, newly-settled juveniles, with animals of intermediate size living in nearby rock habitats or among sessile epifauna. Unlike brittlestar beds on rock, the sediment based beds may contain a rich associated epifauna (Warner, 1971; Allain, 1974; Davoult & Gounin, 1995). Large suspension feeders such as the octocoral Alcyonium digitatum, the anemone Metridium senile and the hydroid Nemertesia antennina are present mainly on rock outcrops or boulders protruding above the brittlestar-covered substratum. The large anemone Urticinafeline may be quite common. This species lives half-buried in the substratum but is not smothered by the brittlestars, usually being surrounded by a 'halo' of clear space (Brun, 1969; Warner, 1971). Large mobile animals commonly found on Ophiothrix beds include the starfish Asterias rubens, Crossaster papposus and Luidia ciliaris, the urchins Echinus esculentus and Psammechinus miliaris, edible crabs Cancer pagurus, swimming crabs Necora puber, Liocarcinus spp., and hermit crabs Pagurus bernhardus. The underlying sediments also contain a diverse infauna including the bivalve Abra alba. Warner (1971) found that numbers and biomass of sediment dwelling animals were not significantly reduced under dense brittlestar patches."

At the sediment surface easily visible fauna include Lagis koreni and Ophiura ophiura. Lagis koreni is an important source of food for commercially important demersal fish, especially dab and plaice (Macer, 1967; Lockwood, 1980 and Basimi & Grove, 1985).                  \r\nTemporal variation: In some areas e.g. Liverpool Bay, MC5-214 and MC6-215 have exhibited cyclical behaviour with the community periodically switching from one biotope to another - possibly in relation to dredge spoil disposal (Rees et al. 1992) along with other environmental and biological factors. Both Lagis koreni and Phaxas pellucidus, are capable of tolerating sudden increases in the deposition of sediment and often dominate such areas following such an event. Indeed it is likely that the two biotopes are merely different aspects of the same community as Lagis koreni is often recorded with high densities of Abra alba (Eagle 1975; Rees and Walker 1983). Densities of mature populations of L. koreni may exceed 1000 per square metre."

The burrowing crustacea present typically include Nephrops norvegicus, which is frequently recorded from surface observations although grab sampling may fail to sample this species. Indeed, some forms of sampling may also fail to indicate seapens as characterising species. This biotope also seems to occur in deep offshore waters in the North Sea, where densities of Nephrops norvegicus may reach 68 per 10 per square metre. (see Dyer et al. 1982, 1983), and the Irish Sea. The burrowing anemone Cerianthus lloydii and the ubiquitous epibenthic scavengers Asterias rubens, Pagurus bernhardus and Liocarcinus depurator are present in low numbers in this biotope whilst the brittlestars Ophiura albida and Ophiura ophiura are sometimes present, but are much more common in slightly coarser sediments. Low numbers of the anemone Pachycerianthus multiplicatus may also be found, and this species, which is scarce in the UK, appears to be restricted to this habitat (Plaza & Sanderson 1997). The infauna may contain significant populations of the polychaetes Pholoe spp., Glycera spp., Nephtys spp., spionids, Pectinaria belgica and Terebellidesstroemi, the bivalves Nucula sulcata, Corbula gibba and Thyasira flexuosa, and the echinoderm Brissopsis lyrifera.                 \r\nSituation: These soft mud habitats occur extensively throughout the more sheltered basins of sealochs and voes (narrow inlets) and are present in quite shallow depths (as little as 15 m) in these areas probably because they are very sheltered from wave action."

Rees pers. comm. 1997; M. Costello pers. comm. 1997). Low numbers of the seapen Virgularia mirabilis may be found in many examples of this biotope. In addition, in certain areas of the UK such as the northern Irish Sea, this community may also contain Nephrops norvegicus and can consequently be the focus for fishing activity (Mackie, Oliver & Rees 1995). Infaunal species in this community are similar to those found in MC6-216 and include the polychaetes Nephtys hystricis, Pectinaria belgica, Glycera spp. and Lagis koreni and the bivalves Myrtea spinifera and Nucula sulcata.

The fauna is normally impoverished at such sites, with few elements of the infaunal communities present in other muddy biotopes. Scavenging species such as Asteriasrubens and Carcinus maenas are typically present where the habitat is not too anoxic along with occasional Arenicolamarina but in extreme conditions of anoxia little survives other than the Beggiatoa.

      "habitat_description": "This biotope typically occurs on the upper faces of deep (commonly below 30m depth), wave-exposed circalittoral rock subject to negligible tidal streams. Although it occurs in exposed and very exposed conditions, at such depth, the turbulent wave action appears to have a much-attenuated effect on the fauna compared with shallower depths. As the majority of records are from depths between 30-50+ m, slightly deeper than the depths of most surveys, it is possible that this biotope is more widespread than the available dataset indicates. The sponge component of this biotope is the most striking feature, with similar species to the bryozoan and erect sponge biotope complex (unit MC1-213) although in this case, the sponges Phakellia ventilabrum, Axinella infundibuliformis, Axinella dissimilis and Stelligera stuposa dominate. Other sponge species frequently found on exposed rocky coasts are also present in low to moderate abundance. These include Cliona celata, Polymastia boletiformis, Haliclona viscosa, Pachymatisma johnstonia, Dysidea fragilis, Suberites carnosus, Stelligera rigida, Hemimycale columella and Tethya aurantium.

The top shell Calliostomazizyphinum is often recorded as present.       \r\nSituation: Unit MC1-2222 probably occurs above unit MD1-211 in shallower water where the exposure of the coast ensures that there is more water mixing due to wave action. Deeper down, this effect is attenuated, allowing MD1-211 biotope to develop.             \r\nTemporal variation: Axinella dissimilis tends to grow extremely slowly."

In the north east Atlantic, Lophelia pertusa is the dominant colonial coral and is the characterising species of the biotope described under this habitat type. Lophelia and its deep-water allies lack the symbiotic algae of their tropical relatives, so can live in the permanent darkness of the deep sea. These corals form colonies and can aggregate into patches and banks which may be described as reefs. These deep-sea corals can support and shelter hundreds of other species, including sponges, polychaete worms, echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, brittle stars) and bryozoans (sea mats). Some 200-300 species can be found in one of these coral habitats, a number comparable to that found in other important deep-water habitats. Unlike tropical coral reef systems, they are dominated by only a few hard-coral species, and there are far fewer fish species."

      "habitat_description": "In deep water and soft muds of Boreal and Arctic areas, a community dominated by foraminiferans and the bivalve Thyasira sp. (e.g. T. croulinensis and T. pygmaea) may occur (Thorson 1957; Künitzer et al. 1992). Foraminiferans such as Saccammina, Psammosphaera, Haplophragmoides, Crithionina and Astorhiza are important components of this community with dead tests numbering thousands per m2 (see Stephen 1923; McIntyre 1961) and sometimes visible from benthic photography (Mackie, Oliver & Rees 1995). It is likely that a community dominated by Astorhiza in fine sands in the Irish Sea may be another distinct biotope (E.I.S. Rees pers. comm. 2002). Polychaetes, e.g. Paraonis gracilis, Myriochele heeri, Spiophanes kroyeri, Tharyx sp., Lumbrineris tetraura, are also important components of this biotope. These communities appear to have no equivalent on the continental plateau further south (Glemarec 1973) but are known from the edge of the Celtic Deep in the Irish Sea (Mackie, Oliver & Rees 1995). The benthos in these offshore areas has been shown to be principally Foraminifera and similar, rich communities may exist in Scottish sealochs (McIntyre 1961). Communities from yet deeper (northern) waters at the extremes of the North Sea may be reminiscent, although dissimilar toMD6-214 (see Pearson et al. 1996) reflecting a higher proportion of silt/clay. A fully Arctic version of this biotope has also been described (Thorson 1934, 1957) although it should be noted that Jones (1950) considered this Boreal foraminiferan community to be part of a 'Boreal Deep Mud Association'.        \r\nSituation: This community typically occurs in water deeper than 100 m in the northern North Sea (Knitzer et al. 1992) and have been referred to as 'Foraminifera communities' by other workers (e.g. Stephen 1923; Thorson 1957; McIntyre 1961)."

      "habitat_description": "Sublittoral soft anoxic mud, often in areas with poor water exchange with the open sea, can have a conspicuous bacterial mat covering of Beggiatoa spp. The anoxia may be a result of natural conditions of poor water exchange in some sealochs (and many Scandinavian fjords) or artificially under fish farm cages from nutrient enrichment. The fauna is normally impoverished at such sites, with few elements of the infaunal communities present in other muddy biotopes. Scavenging species such as Asterias rubens and Carcinus maenas are typically present where the habitat is not too anoxic along with occasional Arenicola marina but in extreme conditions of anoxia little survives other than the Beggiatoa. The polychaete Ophiodromus flexuosus occurs in high densities at the interface between oxygenated and deoxygenated sediments (in Norwegian fjords)."

The two key factors are the absence of light, which rules out photosynthetic organisms, and confinement, which rules out organisms which have a strong trophic requirement. Water renewal in the dark chambers is usually very slight or occasional and depends on local topographical, bathymetrical and geographical factors. The great hydrological stability is indicated by anomalies of temperature, extremely oligotrophic conditions, and biochemical parameters. Positive thermal anomalies are typical of caves with a rising profile (a frequent case in karstic caves) and negative anomalies have been noticed in the rare caves with a descending profile. The very great reduction in the trophic addition from the outside brings about a drastic selection of the animals established in this habitat. The rate of biological cover of the walls of this habitat may be 80 to 50% in the richest areas but can be almost nil in the most confined parts. The selection of trophic groups and morphological groups, as well as the spatial organisation, are governed by environmental conditions that are peculiar to each cave. This biocenosis includes a significant portion of typically deep-sea species, the most original of these being found in caves with a descending profile, with a thermal regime similar to that of the Mediterranean deeps."

It can be difficult to reliably distinguish between coarse sediment and mixed sediment using video data only. Note that mixed sediment has a greater mud content than coarse sediment. If sediment particles are large enough to be classed as gravel using the Folk classification then sediment would be classed as coarse sediment rather than sand. If sand contains a high enough percentage of gravel it is also classed as coarse sediment. Coral rubble is classed as coarse sediment. Stable pebbles, cobbles and boulders are classed as rock; any rock present on coarse sediment is considered a separate habitat within a mosaic."

Volcanic sediments can provide a distinctive character around Icelandic shores. Distinctive invertebrates characterise beaches and their driftlines, providing food for some wading birds."

This facies is a relatively particular aspect of ‘wracks’ and corresponds to the washing up of almost exclusively marine phanerogam debris from nearby meadows and beds. These wracks always include a fairly sizeable part of other additional elements of anthropic or natural origin.

Typically with a more or less complete cover of (relatively low) grasses, herbs, bryophytes and lichens, sometimes with low shrubs, they comprise one of the most species-rich habitats on the temperate European coast. The flora can vary with the regional climate, with the character of the substrate, from acid to highly calcareous, and with the local dune topography. Individual dune systems can vary from narrow strips to enormous stretches, though most are not a dynamic stage in succession, but maintained in a more or less stable fixed state. They were often grazed or mown in the past, and missing dune fixation prevented the development of dense, tall grasslands as well as scrub and woodland. The habitat is threatened in most countries by the abandonment of traditional farming, by eutrophication through nitrogen deposition, overuse and urbanisation, often related to tourism."

They are faunistically and floristically rich and the highly discontinuous nature of their distribution gives rise to a considerable geographical variation in the composition of plant and animal communities, marked by the occurrence of numerous species of local or disjunct occurrence in addition to the basic cortège common to most of them. Besides this geographical variation, the nature of these grasslands also depends, to a great extent, on hydric regime, substrate characteristics and agropastoral treatment, notably on whether they are mowed or grazed and how intensively. In particular, the relative abundance of the main constituent grass species, Bromus erectus, Brachypodium pinnatum s. l., Sesleria albicans and Koeleria pyramidata, varies both geographically with climatic conditions and locally with topography and agropastoral regime. Thus, although separate geographical entities may differ in that relative abundance, similarly differing facies may also coexist locally, producing sharply distinct habitats. To accomodate for these concurrent axes of variation, formations dominated by Brachypodium or by Sesleria, as well as all semidamp formations, are removed from this division and placed in units 34.323, 34.324 and 34.325. Geographical subdivisions, most apt at identifying distinctive plant and animal communities, may be used in the four sections by addition of a fourth decimal digit common to all of them. The regions encompassed by the geographical subdivisions corresponding to each value of this fourth digit are in all cases described under this section although in some of them, or in parts of some of them, there may be no grasslands belonging to unit 34.322, but only grasslands belonging to units 34.323, 34.324 or 34.325; these cases have, as much as possible, been identified under each of the subdivisions below."

Therefore the name should be changed, e.g. Continental steppic grassland (including the true steppe). For the steppe zone, this habitat is probably too broad. It includes specific types on rock outcrops (petrophytic steppe) and on solonetz soil (solonetz steppe), each of them with a distinct group of specialist species.

Typically found as strips along streams and on the edges of forests, in the shelter of large rocks, on mountain ledges and under scrub, sometimes also fringing snowbeds where it benefits from protection from winter frosts. The vegetation is often very rich in species and hosts many local and regional endemics, as well as widespread montane plants. Vulnerable to grazing by wild herbivores and stock, but often protected by its remoteness."

Vegetation e.g. of Frankenion pulverulentae. They are more species-rich or richer in non-Chenopodiaceae than the communities of unit A2.551 (of EUNIS 2012); they are particularly developed in the Iberian peninsula, secondarily in the large Mediterranean islands, in coastal regions and endoreic basins of North Africa, in southern Italy and Mediterranean France; they occur as irradiations on thermo-Atlantic coasts, notably on the Atlantic coast of France. Somewhat similar communities occur in the steppe zones of Eurasia and their regions of influence, as well as in Saharo-Mediterranean steppes of North Africa; they are included in unit R623."

      "habitat_description": "Salt steppes and saltmarsh meadows of the Pannonic plain and its satellite basins. Large expanses of salt steppe form an open landscape of short-grass swards on slightly elevated ground (unit R6211) and of rills (units R6213, R6214), eroded shallow depressions with bare or sparsely vegetated saline soils, dry or moist in spring and prone to white salt efflorescences. Deeper rills, with less ephemeral water, support medium-tall saline meadows (unit R6212). This unit is represented by the alliance Beckmannion eruciformis in the Carpathians and includes small-area fragments. Waterholes that dot the surface harbour brackish aquatic vegetation (unit C1.523 of EUNIS 2012) and are fringed by tall emergents (units C3, D5, in particular halophile communities of C3.27 of EUNIS 2012); their drying muds, subjected to prolonged immersion, are colonised by pioneer formations of Chenopodiaceae (unit D6.161 of EUNIS 2012) or crypsoid grasses (unit R623). These ensembles of communities are mainly represented in the central Pannonic plain, east of the Tisza, in the Danube lowlands of the Tisza-Danube interfluve and in the Neusiedler See (Lake Ferto) basin. Smaller relics persist in the Danube lowlands of Slovakia, in the eastern Pannonic plain and Transylvanian basin of Romania, in the Voivodina and have survived until recently in Moravia, where they may now be extinct. Outside of the Pannonic basin, western outposts of the continental salt steppes and saltmarshes (unit R62) are also known from the Bohemian basin and from isolated intermontane basins of the southwestern Balkan peninsula; the Bohemian communities have long been extinct; the extremely localized Balkanic ones, although equally related to the Pannonic and Pontic formations, have, for convenience, been includedhere, since they share their extreme western location within the Eurasian salt steppe complex. Species composition depends on two gradients – soil moisture and salination. Important species are Chenopodium chenopodioides, Crypsis aculeata, Spergularia salina, Scirpus pumilus, Juncus gerardi and Melilotus macrorrhizus."

The accompanying flora may include Salix alba, Salixelaeagnos, Salix purpurea, Alnus glutinosa, Cercis siliquastrum, Celtis australis, Populus alba, Populus nigra, Juglans regia, Fraxinus ornus, Alnus glutinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Cornus sanguinea, Ruscus aculeatus, Vitex agnus-castus, Nerium oleander, Rubus spp., Rosa sempervirens, Hedera helix, Clematis vitalba, Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris, Ranunculus ficaria, Anemone blanda, Aristolochia rotunda, Saponaria officinalis, Symphytum bulbosum, Hypericum hircinum, Calamintha grandiflora, Melissa officinalis, Helleboruscyclophyllus, Cyclamen hederifolium, Cyclamen repandum, Cyclamen creticum, Galanthus nivalis ssp. reginae-olgae, Dracunculus vulgaris, Arum italicum, Biarum tenuifolium, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Dactylis glomerata and may be rich in mosses, lichens and ferns, among which Pteridium aquilinum is often abundant. Various associations have been described, reflecting regional and ecological variation in the composition of the undergrowth. The plane tree galleries are particularly well represented along the Ionian coast and in the Pindus; other important local complexes exist in Macedonia, in Thrace, around the Olympus massif, in the Pelion, in the Peloponnese, particularly in the Taygetos, where luxuriant gorge forests reach 1300 metres, in Euboea and in Crete; local, distinctive, representatives occur in other Aegean islands, such as Rhodes, Samos, Samothrace, Thasos. Restriction to gorges is increasingly pronounced towards the south."

In many areas remnant tall Quercus coccifera may form arborescent matorral, as for instance on Ossa; coppice-like formations of young trees also occur."

The size, shape and regularity of the blocks vary according to the local character of the bedrock and the climate, and much of the surface is bare but slowly accumulating soil. The shelter of crevices provides a variety of situations for colonisation. Drought-resistant communities of cushions of bryophytes and lichens and fragments of dry tufted grasslands can occur in exposed situations, whereas there is a more luxuriant vegetation of ferns, herbs, shrubs and trees at sheltered sites. Wind and herbivores often curtail any surface spread. The composition of the flora contrasts markedly between the major areas of occurrence."

Different types of glacier exist. Characteristic for the arctic regions, ice sheets and ice caps are dome-like ice masses unconstrained by topography. In the large mountain ranges, but also in the arctic regions, most glaciers are constrained by topography including cirque glaciers, valley glaciers, mountain glaciers and piedmont glaciers. The smallest form of glaciers is derived from snow-drifting, avalanches, or ice deposition in cold-bottom karst dolines, called glacierets.

Such communities are listed in units Q11114 to Q11116, as well as in Q1114 and in Q1121; in some of them sphagna may be scarce or replaced by bryopsid mosses. Well-defined sphagnum hummocks of unit Q11111 may nevertheless develop in conjunction with them.

It is widely distributed through Europe, though usually highly localised, with the largest areas reported from the Nordic countries. On the matted carpets of sedges and other vascular plants typical of minerotrophic situations, sphagna, other mosses and often abundant liverworts develop, thicker stretches sometimes forming irregular ombrotrophic hummocks. The main threat for such mires is drainage, leading quickly and often irreversibly to the development of other habitats, like poor fens. Quaking areas in percolation mires (which have a much higher species richness) need a very long time to regenerate after rewetting if the regulatory mechanism of the peat body has been destroyed by drainage."

The carpet of Sphagnum peat limits the penetration of thaw, maintaining a perennially frozen core of peat, silt and ice lenses beneath. Pounikko hummock ridges can be found in marginal areas subject to seasonal freezing, and there are plateau-wide palsas and string mires in the Arctic. Intact palsa mounds show a patterning of weakly minerotrophic vegetation with different assemblages of mosses, herbs and sub-shrubs on their tops and sides. Old palsa mounds can become dry, and erosion may lead to melting and collapse. A complete melting leaves behind thermokarst ponds."

The occurrence of different dominant species depends on water depth, duration of flooding, substratum, trophic level, disturbance by waves or current, herbivory and human influence, some of the plants being cut for fodder or thatching. Because of the competitive ability and clonal growth of tall helophytes, the stands are usually species-poor and often dominated by one or a few co-dominants. The habitat is vulnerable to drainage and pollution, land reclamation for agricultural and urban development, and the decline of marshland exploitation for renewable crops."
